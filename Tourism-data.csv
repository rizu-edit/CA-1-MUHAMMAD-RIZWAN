Nimeesh L,The atmosphere at the Hotel is very welcoming and homely. It would be great if the food menu offerings at the restaurant would include more vegetarian options.

Tehmina S,"I frequently travel to Karachi from Lahore for work. I choose to stay at the Avari hotel, as the overall experience from check in to check out, provides a genuine taste of hospitality and service. No matter how busy the front desk may be, Ms Rashna made my check in smooth and welcoming. Smiling faces eagerly assisted towards moving my luggage to my room. Throughout the stay, despite constraints presented by Covid-19, the Room service was efficient, tasty and beautifully presented. After a long working day, it was a pleasure to return to a room that was thoroughly cleaned. Overall, the staff at Avari Karachi ensured one does not miss home and made my stay a comfortable and welcoming one. Thank you Avari Karachi!",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Shaheer K.,"The check in was smooth & effortless. Our concerns were addressed on the spot, and we were bumped up to an excellent room with a fantastic view of the city skyline and the port, without even asking for it.   At checkout, we were given clear, unbiased and accurate information in response to our questions.  People like them make stays at Avari serve as reminders of the pure spirit of what Karachi was like in the 1930's, 40', 50's and 60's, with a modern twist and all the technological trappings of present times.  If you are a Karachi resident who wants to disconnect from the stress, noise, pollution, aggressive behaviour and annoying relatives and travel back to a time when this city was a compulsory stopover on a world-traveller's map, you should go to one of Avari's properties.…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

AttiqueAhmed,"Avari is the only hotel in Karachi amongst the 4-5 star category where I can enjoy a restful sleep.   The airconditioning works well, the marble bathroom is fantastic with a great shower, and service quality is excellent.   I hope they will revamp their gym soon as it does not match the standard this hotel maintains for the rest of its facilities and services. ",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Khusro A,"Excellent stay but it was only made further comfortable due to Mujeeb the duty manager, extremely welcoming and too helpful, stay was superb Thankx to Mujeeb.. excellent rooms very tastefully done indeed AVARI is the place.. ",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Bilal Junaid,"I stayed at Avari Towers Karachi  (With Family) from 5th January 2022 till 9th January 2022. Below are all the problems i faced. All complaints were communicated  to the reception timely during my stay, to the point where we just wanted our stay to end so we could go home. It was a terrible experience!   1. 6th January - First Issue :  The room was very cold at night. We witnessed some cold few days in Karachi, which is rather unusual. We tried to increase the temperature of our thermostat to the highest, but it just wouldn't heat. I went down to the reception frustrated & got to know that the hotel doesn't have a heating facility! LOL. Imagine, staying at a 5 Star and not having a heating facility. Since this happened  on my first night, i decided to not make a big deal about…",3,Avari Towers Karachi
Faisal Iftekhar,Love the hospitality. Super thankful to Rashna for all the support. Always my favourite place to stay when in Karachi.  Staff was following covid compliance and the room service was super fast. Keep it up!,5,Avari Towers Karachi
vasay,"I had a great stay at avari and the hotel staff ,from front desk managers l to the cleaning staff, all were very very helpful. I would Highly recommend Avari karachi as the cleanliness level is also very well maintained",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Ahad Q,The staff is very good and do go out of their way to assist. But the hotel itself is dated and desperately needs renovation. The rooms have excellent beds but you can easily appreciate rust on the window panes. This is certainly not something you expect from Avari. The breakfast was very good but things which got finished off in the buffet were never refilled.  It was a weird sort of a visit wherein each and every aspect showed potential but in the end was left lacking.,3,Avari Towers Karachi
Shunni,"I’d like to start with the receptionist, my welcome was so good with such hospitality that i did not experience in any hotel in pakistan, receptionist name is Humaira, she cooperated with us and make a good way to start our trip, she also asks us time by time that how was our stay, so big thumbs up to her, then room was also neat and tidy up to standard, room service was also efficient, house keeping staff was so well mannered and easy to cooperate, food was also good, just one thing i miss the most in the room was smart tv, they should now atleast install smart tv for their guests. Over all it was more than good , happy stay",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Phil F,Avari Towers is my prime choice of hotels in Karachi. It is comfortable; the staff are extremely attentive; the restaurants are good all round (and the view from the Sky-bbq is fantastic) and its security measures add another level of comfort that cannot be found in hotels elsewhere in the city. I reviewed the standard of secuity at all the major international hotels in the city in the past and Avari came out tops two years ago - and on my latest visit (November 2011) I am satisfied to see that its level of service and security has continued to improve. I will be staying here again when I visit in 2012.,5,Avari Towers Karachi
Andrew12345295414,"Flawless international service, famous Pakistani warmth - and a Scottish manager who once cooked haggis for Idi Amin. You can't go wrong! Particularly appreciated was the fast, free and no-fuss internet in the rooms and throughout the hotel.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
nasrzia,"My stay at Avari Tower was really comfortable. Staff was really efficient and always on their toes to serve you. I felt totally nurtured by the incredible team of their staff. I have travelled the world to some of the most exclusive hotels and can honestly say that the service here was more distinguished, subtle and effective than anywhere I have been. Breathtaking!   Room was just a fabulous fusion of modern European - stylish and comfortable. Very clean but small as compared to other five star hotels. It has one relaxing chair and a very efficient working chair along with a very comfortable bed.   Initially I was given a non smoking room on the sixth floor which was recently refurbished and equipped with modern amenities like flat screen TV, wireless keyboard and mouse…",4,Avari Towers Karachi
StephanieWebb,"The Avari is an oasis of sanity. It's exceedingly well-run, comfortable, functional. The staff members are friendly, efficient, fast, but unobtrusive. On this past trip two different front-desk clerks really went out of their way to help me resolve a complicated problem, well beyond the call of duty. Their commitment was extremely impressive. Breakfast isn't fantastic, but it's fine. The wifi works well everywhere. The bar on the 10th floor is a nice respite. The place is scrupulously clean, and big on small, cozy touches. It has a bit of a ghostly atmosphere - somehow the lobby always feels empty - and the garden IS always empty - and you can feel somewhat isolated from Karachi, out there beyond the walls - but then, that's not always a bad thing. Two small complaints, the…",4,Avari Towers Karachi

stepstra,"I have visited Karachi on week-long business trips five times in as many months and always stayed at the Avari Towers. It has the warmth and comfort of living at home, if only my home were a five-star hotel. I wholeheartedly join in the chorus of praise posted by the other reviewers below.   The security is state of the art; it must be the safest spot in all of Pakistan.  The rooms (at least those on the Executive floors where I have always stayed) are business chic, designed and furnished in a Japanese/ German spartan mood of whitewashed walls, blonde wood, white marble, and mirrors. Further, the rooms and bathrooms, and indeed the entire hotel are spotlessly clean, gleaming, and cheerful. The beds strike the perfect balance of firmness, and the sheets are of the highest thread…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
naveedshah,"My large family -mother,wife and 4 kids(from Nottingham) wanted to visit our relatives in Karachi over Ramzan and Eid holidays and wrote directly to the hotel’s General Manager (Gordan J Gorman)to ask for a special long stay deal, which he arranged for us at great rates, around 100 pounds per room per night including a magnificent breakfast buffet containing all our long missed traditional local favorites, and free broadband internet.     When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the newly opened ultra modern rooms, (better than most back home in the UK) the delicious local and international food served in its many restaurants, the spotless clean condition of the hotel, and the tight security and particularly the ultimate personalised service, all of…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Thomas R.,"The Avari is a five star hotel with complex security measures ranging from barriers, scanners, explosive detectors, armed guards and watchdogs. The hotel is a bit remote to the street, probably too far to get badly blasted by a car bomb. The Sheraton, Marriott and the Pearl Continental are more exposed. The hotel underwent recently extensive renovation. The rooms are generously big, modern furnished and comfortable. The beds offer good sleeping comfort. Different kinds of pillows can be ordered from the pillow menu. The rooms are equipped with a large flat screen TV, a relax chair, safety box, internet access is free and fast. The bathrooms are modern, well stocked with good quality toiletries and a pair of slipper.  A fruit platter is provided daily, a cinnamon muffin is…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
pegasustr,"The hotel is declared by many companies and country ambassadors as safe haven in Karachi. There are enough guards that makes sure the guests security.   The property is 17 floors and have smoker and non-smoker rooms. The room that I got was probably recently renovated one with average size room, fridge, shower, Thin flat screen TV, air condition. Room is slightly dirty but acceptable, if you consider the circumstances. Breakfast is moderate   Hotel offers one Japanese restaurant that is actually surprisingly quite good. That is on the top floor with Karachi view. Another one is at -1 that offers Chinese food that is also good. Both of them do not offer alcoholic beverages.  The hotel offers Hertz cars with driver, if you want to go from hotel that this option. Do not leave on…",3,Avari Towers Karachi
L00K-See,Efficient hotel that meets the business traveler's needs.   Rooms (Business Class and Executive Class) are a notch above the Standard rooms. These are more spacious. Bathrooms in all rooms are definitely odd with opaque glass walls/doors.   Service is courteous but slow.  The Chinese restaurant Dynasty is very good. Breakfast in the lobby restaurant is good too.  Security appears to be tight and definitely makes for a secure feeling. Hotel is surrounded by open spaces with restricted access to entrance X-rays machines for baggage and airport type scanners at entrance.  Would stay here again,3,Avari Towers Karachi
Abid R,"I always prefer in Karachi Avari Tower and consider this hotel as my 2nd home just because of its dedicated staff particularly DM Mujeeb sahab, his problem solving and caring attitude always compel me to prefer Avari Tower for stay, according to my opinion any place or service can be number one just because of its staff or you can say peoples, which are the real asset of any property or organization, the care the service the affection the affinity is just because of the peoples over there, I will rank this hotel on top for stay in Karachi.",5,Avari Towers Karachi

It’s value for money! Perfect for families. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Karachi.,4,Avari Towers Karachi
Basit S,"Stayed in executive lounge 307. Experience wasn’t very pleasant. Instead of traditional reception counter, tables with insufficient staff as well as chairs were placed. Had to wait extra ordinary long to get my room allocated. Rooms were too congested. Telephone set placed on the bedside table was out of order. Bathroom fittings(taps etc) were not comfortable for use.",1,Avari Towers Karachi
Prof. (Dr) Imran,"I stayed at the Avari Hotel Karachi in mid December and was immediately struck by the location and the sophisticated elegant and inviting interior of the lobby. We were incredibly fortunate to have encountered Mr Mujeeb Khan who is a Senior Manager who absolutely transformed our stay. We booked into the Suite rooms on the 15th floor. The marble interior of the bathroom and the spacious suite felt as if we had arrived in a top 5 star hotel in Dubai.  Having stayed at the competing hotels for many years,  I will make Avari my preferred stay in Karachi.  I am fortunate enough to travel the globe as a visiting Doctor, Professor and Teacher and would rate this experience as one of my best. A huge part of this was due to Mujeeb Khan. Thank you Avari for my 5 star 🌟 experience. …",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Zeeshan M.,"0/10 - would not recommend. I've stayed at the Avari here in Karachi a few times now anytime we have business in Pakistan, and for the most part, the experience has been fairly decent...upon till my Dec 2021 visit. I had informed the staff weeks prior to my arrival that I will be arriving early and had provided a specific check-in time window to the staff as well. Upon arrival, the staff began playing the blame-game on who had spoken with me and messed up my check-in rather than anyone apologizing and quickly working to fix the issue. I waited 4 hours in the lobby before a room was ready. Absolutely unacceptable. Will not ever be staying here again.",1,Avari Towers Karachi
Farrukh Naik,"I almost stayed over a months period during this quarter of the year 2021. Once with family and two times being a Solo traveller. No matter what the case may be Avari Towers is always proved to be the best among it's competitors. You talk of location, cleanliness, food quality, the aesthetics of room comfort and above all the staff all are outstanding.  Hats off to the team for providing an ambience of all the care and respect they show to their customers. House keeping department service os also worth praising.  I give some extra points to Ali and Noshaib for their rapid and good response towards quality service. The check in and Check out has always been facilitated by putting extra efforts by Guest Relation Manager Ms Rashna. I think she is the best. I always admired her…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Munima S,"I booked with Avari after much deliberation and recommendations from friends and family . I was coming from USA after 2 years accompanying my two elderly parents . They were both in wheel chairs . The staff was beyond helpful very respectful and courteous . Specially Mr Waseem , Mr Bashir , Mr Gul , Ms Nazia in house keeping and Mr Durrani . The front desk was very very accommodating as  well .  Only one concern was the rental company staff . Though cars and drivers were beyond belief courteous and helpful , the scheduler Mr Sulaiman was very courteous and nice , he kept his word whenever we arranged a car but Mr Mohkishan despite me telling him several times that I have two elderly disabled prison and I need a car to take them to Aga khan hospital , did not keep his word when I…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Mansour A,"Avari was my choice of hotel as it was close to the wedding avent. The check in was a very pleasant experience and the staff extremely helpful.   We got the twin bedroom, which was tastefully decorated, with all sorts of modern amenities (flat screen tv, LED reading light etc). Beds were comfortable and the sweet thing was that they offered you a choice of pillows you need (contour, feather etc).   The breakfast was awesome, with a full range of items ranging from Pakistani to Japanese with everything in between. The omelette was excellent.   The hotel provided a free pick and drop shuttle to and from airport which was a great advantage given the crazy traffic in Karachi.  The best part: super fast free wifi throughout the hotel!

estarman,"It was my first time in Pakistan, therefore I didn't really know what to expect. Happy to report a pleasant experience at the Avari towers, good service (most of the time) and pretty good food.   The car was waiting at the airport right away, which was nice. it's probably 30 minutes to the hotel tops. The lobby and common areas are nothing extraordinary but certainly pleasant. Going to the more important things: the room was great, not new but everything was clean, no complaints. For a 1-week stay, bad hotel food can really affect your experience, but in my case I found it quite good, at all at the 3 restaurants I trried. The mega-prawn and fish teppanyaki at the Japanese was absolutely delicious. I would never have tried the Japanese food in Karachi but I shared the airport…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
James T,"This is a classic style centrally located hotel for your Karachi stay with old style comfortable and spacious rooms.  While it is a little worn at the edges you will enjoy a very high standard of food, service and attention from very friendly staff.  What the hotel lacks in the latest technologies it more than makes up for with very friendly and helpful staff, most of whom maintain a smile in even the most trying of circumstances.  The front desk staff could do with some additional training on local places (even did not know a major wedding venue across street from hotel) and how to handle stressful situations, even a more efficient way to handle routine requests.  However, the patient watchful guest can enjoy the experience provided he or she allows a little extra time.  You…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

It never fails to amaze me on its elaborate and finer touches that a 5* hotel should provide the world over - The Avari Towers has it down to a fine art, A must stay for all those business people who require the comforts of home in a top notch 5* hotel where all the little things mean everything.

Some of us returned for a day after a 2-day visit to Lahore.  Though our first stay 213 on the ""smoking"" floor was not so pleasant as we were non-smokers but every other aspect, the food was delicious and the bakery products outstanding!  The staff were ever-helpful to fulfill our needs.  When we requested for more than the less-than-adequate complimentary water, we were provided that to a limited degree.  The water should be at least 2 litres for each guest.  Also wish the toilets were built for more privacy as delegates were sharing rooms.

Malik Y,I have been staying at Avari Towers Karachi since 1993 for my official Business Trips. Nowadays I am visiting Karachi more frequently for about 30-40 days a year. As per my experience of travelling nationwide and abroad I found Avari Staff extremely hospitable and highly courteous especially of front desk. I can't forget their warm Welcomes and Cherished Good Bye since a period sprawling over 3 decades. I had developed a home like affiliations with the property.,5,Avari Towers Karachi
IssacAhmad,They offered me an upgrade to business room which was on 3rd floor and it was terrible super smelly and dusty room. Their rugs under the bed are super old and super smelly and I am sure there would be billion dust mites if not bed bugs. They then offered me room at 16th floor and it was recently renovated like in last couple of years but smell was there too. At middle of night around 2 am they turned off A/C which was noticeable because during those days Karachi temp at night was 20c so I called to reception but they never received call so I had to call thru my cell phone to the hotel reservation number and they made an excuse of  filter issue which was not true. The second night they did the same thing and I called them again and threaten them and they turned on A/C like in 30…,1,Avari Towers Karachi

We booked last minute for my sisters wedding during Covid and everyone was beyond helpful, friendly and accommodating despite all the noise we made. We were picked up from the Airport by the hotel who provided a very professional and fast service.   Despite the Covid situation, the staff organised a function room for us at short notice for one of our events and helped in organising the food. Despite the restaurants being closed, we were able to order food to our rooms which was very tasty and room service was available 24/7.

S T,"My brother was getting married and my first choice of hotel was Pearl Continental but that was fully booked. As I had stayed in the Lahore Avari Hotel I thought this hotel would be similar unfortunately not. This hotel has a lower class room called a world traveller room which I did not stay in. I stayed on the 3rd floor and apparently these rooms where meant to be nice. The bathroom ate up the bedroom space. The bathroom was just two glass walls and a walk in shower which leaked out into the room. The bedroom over looked a building site where the banging started quite early in the morning. The curtains were filthy, housekeeping didn’t care to change bedding everyday. I was not impressed with this hotel and wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.",2,Avari Towers Karachi

Waqas M,Avari offers tranquillity after a long journey or a stressful day at work.

Mariyam S,"Very disappointed with the stay at Avari. Given the price I had expected a better standard of services 1. The check-in, even after midnight, took over 30 minutes.  2. The glass bathrooms are so tricky to navigate - there is one glass door, which doubles as the main bathroom door and the shower door. On top of that, the shower door opens outward so any towel placed on the marble floor to avoid slippage would get pushed aside. Highly unpractical design and room van not be shared! 3. The dinner buffet experience was very traumatic as there was a piece of broken glass in the chana/chick peas salad. I found it in a bite and still shudder at the thought of what could have happened had it cut my tongue or some internal organ.",2,Avari Towers Karachi
Wajahat Ullah,I stayed in their avari business class room which was located on the executive floor. The room was spacious though the view from the balcony was limited and looked towards the residential buildings nearby. The wooden floor gave the room an exclusive touch. Bed was comfortable super comfortable to sleep. Bathroom had a bath tub with all luxurious amenities. In room dining menu was limited and highly priced. Room service is rather slow. Breakfast buffet was extensive; however my experience at the sky bbq which is at the top level of the hotel wasn’t too spectacular. The food was limited and wasn’t much of a higher quality as expected from a 5 star hotel. They even charged extra for the mint lemonade which was served half an hour later.,4,Avari Towers Karachi

MarieMalmo,I stayed for two nights first on the third floor where the noise of the fans outside disturbed my sleep. The hotel was fully booked so I was not able to be transferred until the following day when I ended up at the 10th floor (next to the Business Lounge) which was a quiet room.  Rooms are well sized and staff welcoming. Wifi worked well and safety seemed well catered for. Breakfast was good (not fantastic) and service in the lobby snack area prompt and courteous.  Cleaning can be improved - in the second room the used soap from a previous occupant was still in the messy soap dish and the draw backs of having glass walls separating the bathroom from the rest of the room is that all kinds of marks and splatter are easily spotted on the walls.

David L,"The Avari Towers in Karachi is one of the most pleasant hotel stays I have experienced in my many years of travel.  From the minute I arrived, I was treated with surprising courtesy and a genuine regard for my well being.  The entire staff went out of their way to make me feel at home and safe from the elements.  The rooms are modern, the beds are very comfortable, the internet is fast, the service is about as good as it gets it and the restaurants are fantastic.  The hotel is run by a seasoned hotelier, Mr. Gordon Gorman, who has a passion for detail and maintaining Five Star standards.  I could see he pays as much attention to his staff as he does his guests which makes for a winning team and an excellent stay. I've found my home away from home while in Karachi.

I decided to pick the Avari Towers to stay in for a month, having seen the recommendation on trip advisor on the first instance.    I must admit as soon as I stepped inside the hotel I felt very safe and secure. The Avari have a great deal of security and this was a high priority to me. You have to cross three security barriers before you can actually get in. I really liked this. When I entered the reception I found it to look clean beautiful and sparkling.(Was I still in Pakistan)?  I was impressed.

It’s in a good location & close to all the amenities of a very friendly city. It’s a well-run hotel by a very nice, friendly, approachable General Manager. The rooms, pool, restaurants, reception, laundry, housekeeping all faultless. There is Hertz hire cars within the hotel grounds, at a very reasonable price & with very friendly, helpful staff & drivers. Try the Sky lounge on floor 10, you’ll be well served by the very lovely Arif.

Setting up meant that the garden was out of action from 2 pm,pool chairs removed, fencing put round the pool.  The pool changing rooms and towels badly need replacing. Drilling through marble took place on Thursday and Friday so it was not possible to hold a conversation in the lobby. The staff are a delight and the laundry service excellent. However on four mornings my door bell was rung before 9 am asking if I would like my room made up, a little too early. On the fifth day the bed was not made until after 1 pm .

Hammad,The property is situated in the heart of Karachi about 20-30 minutes away from the main airport. The rooms are in need of an upgrade but are still liveable.   The food here is okay. Nothing special but better than other hotels in the area. I wouldn’t recommend Dynasty— the Chinese restaurant. The quality is pathetic and they haven’t done anything to improve it.  Avari offers free Airport pick and drop. Make sure you schedule your departure and arrival at the time of booking.   The staff need to be reminded of basic instructions against and again. Lobby area offers decent coffee. Over all not a bad spot to stay in Karachi. It’s a short drive to the shopping district and other attractions.   ,3,Avari Towers Karachi

Cleaning service in the rooms and in the common portions of the hotel is completely in live with the five stars of the hotel.

In the toilet, i could hear what was going on in the adjacent room toilet. Well, breakfast was just about pathetic, breads were too hard and not fresh, limited menu. I was second in queue for omellette but the cook started serving all the ladies who came after me. The biggest surprise was in store for me when i ordered water bottle in the room. 1.5 liter bottle was billed at PKR 396. I would take up this matter with Consumer Rights Council in Karachi.

Rooms are ok but there pool needs lot of improvement i mean water should be clean tiles of pool need to clean. Gym not up to the standards out of 5 treadmills two give u electric shock while using them. Steam room is disaster overall facilities they are providing other than room and food are pathetic. I launch my complaint but no result i think due to heavy inflow they are least interested to change.

In a volatile city like Karachi you need a safe haven and the Avari is certainly that. Gordon and his staff could not be more helpful. The rooms and the decor in the hotel are newly re-furbished and luxurious. Most of all, in current times, the security in and around the hotel and the constant monitoring of this makes you feel assured that all is well so you are able to relax and carry out your business.",4,Avari Towers Karachi

Who would have thought that you could swim in a gigantic swimming pool surrounded by gardens in the middle of Karachi? The level of security at the hotel is exceptional so one feels very secure and relaxed while staying there which is important.  The hotel has been renovated recently so it’s effectively ‘brand new’.

Once through the security cordon and up the drive, the staff are welcoming and the facilities good - free fast WiFi, many channels on the flat-screen TV, comfortable bed and luxury shower in the newly-renovated rooms. There is a fairly good range of foods at breakfast and plenty of choice from the menu at lunch and dinner if the buffet is not what you want.

ilminstertraveller,"Booked into the Avari by a client on my first trip to Pakistan. Not particularly attractive on the outside with about 16 floors. Tight security, surrounded by fence with armed guards and a pleasant garden and pool. The service is excellent and the staff cannot do enough for you. Spacious luxurious lobby, seated check in with a cool drink and coffee available for my 04.30 checkout. The room was large, comfortable with a big bed, bathroom and amenities. Complimentary fruit, bottled water and WIFI. Will be coming back in a couple of days and will report again.",4,Avari Towers Karachi
Kuyosh K,"Avari was my home for 3 months and I am lucky that my company can afford it. Needless to say that we have negotiated a good deal, but even then, the cost was twice higher than of Marriott or Sheraton. With that of course, came all the extras: free laundry, upgrade to the exec floor. The rooms are newly renovated, cleanliness is unquestionable, staff is super polite, and food is great. The pool, the gym, tennis court are all extras you need for a long stay and they all are in perfect shape. The staff that takes care of these premises is attentive and accommodating. I am back again, but this time around, Marriott won the bid offering the value for the buck my company pays.",5,Avari Towers Karachi

If the quality of food improves no doubt it would be the most preferred hotel in Khi.",4,Avari Towers Karachi

The check-in process is time taking though, but it is smooth as well.   Rooms have enough space and beds are cozy and the pool location is great. Overall, it is a genuine five stars hotel and I recommend this to everyone who visits Karachi.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
hrashid72,I have recently started to prefer Avari over other hotels in Karachi because the hotel has very polite staff and I sense diversity in the staff.   Rooms are a bit small but functional and hotel services seem to work well.  Also their restaurants are quite decent. ,5,Avari Towers Karachi

Every time I return they seem to add a little extra touch to make your stay more enjoyable...most recently a place in the tower to sit and have a beverage and chat with your friends, clients or invited guests.  Great addition!!!",5,Avari Towers Karachi
zaayernasib,"Although the room I stayed in was pretty small as compared to the rooms in Movenpick Karachi, it was neat and pretty clean. The washrooms were clean as well though again smaller than expected. The floor however had a smell to it which I couldn't exactly place. So walking from the elevator to the room was not a pleasant experience. Breakfast was amazing with a decent variety. The staff was very helpful throughout the 2 day stay and offered assistance whenever they saw guests and made us feel very comfortable. There is a market nearby which has factory outlets (discounted outlets) of local and international brands, which is nice. Overall the stay was very good and I recommend it highly.",4,Avari Towers Karachi
alive_silkjive,"Exactly what you would expect from an award winning hotel: hospitality, guest centric experience, empathy especially after long haul flight and earlier (other) hotel fiasco. Cuisine is fantastic with various global selections. Gym and pool are definitely a plus, especially in Karachi's humidity. The staff were extremely courteous and offered us a free upgrade as well to business suites. Marble adds to the glitter of fifth floor business suites. Overall, a fantastic experience.  Given the challenges Karachi as a city faces, it is important to maintain the world class exterior. White furniture around pool area certainly needs a refresh.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Afreina N,Had to wait 45 minutes to get the room that had already been booked by my company. Then the bed sheets had hair on them from the previous occupant. A colleague of mine found a used razor in new packing in the amenities. The shower didn't have hot running water while the sink did. Check in and check out were both terrible. Way to welcome someone to your city. I was there for a night - and thank god it was only a night. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Room was fine looks wise. had to call housekeeping twice - every time - to get my clothes collected for ironing.  The lunch and breakfast buffet - full of food ... inedible food.  Everything looks good on the outside. Just crumbles the moment you experience it.,1,Avari Towers Karachi
SarahKTravels,"Before I continue with my review, I will put it out there that I was checking in with very high expectations. I have stayed at the other top hotels in the area and work never brought me to Avari due to purely budgetary reasons beyond my control.   My stay was uneventful. Staff was courteous, hotel was clean, wifi and air conditioning worked well. During check out, I was being charged for the minibar which I hadn't used. When I told them I hadn't used it, the hotel staff was very professional, didn't bat an eyelash, and said it wasn't a problem. I would expect exactly that kind of an attitude from a property of their level, well done!   My problem was that I was expecting to be wowed and I wasn't. This property has the reputation for being the ""best"" of the local hotels in the…",4,Avari Towers Karachi

Juan2013,"Very nice hotel, in the center of Karachi. Plenty of security and the rooms are very nice and big. I got a room the 16th floor and was very quiet. They have a bar in floor 10 were they serve beers as in Pakistan you are not allowed to drink alcohol in public places. I recomend this hotel for business purposes",5,Avari Towers Karachi
NxNW13,"This is a very good choice business hotel, well located and well maintained. I would like to highlight all the staff in the reception area as being particularly helpful, using their own initiative where required. The only faults I would find are the slightly confusing process of booking a car, which meant sometimes it was easier to take a rickshaw despite the security situation, and the temperature of the swimming pool. How the water was so cold on a tepid day, I cannot imagine, but the result is that the pool is difficult to enjoy in February. The rooms suffered from a certain amount of neighbouring building noise but not at unsociable hours. I would, however, definitely stay again, based primarily on the quality of the staff. I would have liked to try the tennis facilities but…",4,Avari Towers Karachi

I stayed per night somehow 300-315 USD that you can stay in Dubai in 5-6 stars  hotels or at beach or resort.. the reservation people are not helpful at all. the amenities and services provided were not alike with respect to previous stay. the room was cold and I asked mobile heater. till morning, i noticed the socket was melted :-(..

pilgrim_gsa,The hotel is well located and has excellent standards of service backed with good food and ambience that spells class .Breakfast is well spread with great selections of local and continental dishes .Wifi is excellent in the rooms to and the elevators always seemed waiting for you on every floor ..one sore point at busy hotels usually overlooked .The only downside -you had to ask for a hair dryer which every room of this class is expected to be provided with .,4,Avari Towers Karachi
KarinGlobal,"The hotel was very quiet when we arrived and check-in relatively fast. I was escorted to my tiny room (not sure what my company booked), and I could see on the fire exit plan that most rooms were well double the size. On the plus side, my room was modern and the bathroom and air con worked very well. This was in contrast to the rest of the hotel which felt overall quite dated and tired.   Having said that, I felt very secure, as the hotel has a lot of security and is well protected, which is the most important aspect. Electricity and wifi worked fantastically well which was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend staying there, but expect old fashioned charm.

HB_Toronto,"I stayed at the hotel in late December. I enjoyed the hospitality and service.  They charged my card for a certain amount at the time of check-in. Actual bill was less and I was promised the money will be refunded to my credit card within a week.   First few weeks I kept calling on phone and was assured the funds will be refunded and that it takes some time. Towards the end of January, I connected with their credit supervisor, a gentleman by the name of Mr. Ramzan.  He instructed someone to refund my credit card on urgent basis and copied me on the email. A week later, I reminded that funds had not been refunded to the account. He sent another email; another week passed by. I followed up again and asked for General Managers's email so I could escalate the issue. I never heard…",1,Avari Towers Karachi

Super comfy, cosy room (although a tad cold for me even after I turned the AC off but thats just a personal room temperature preference). I asked for an extra blanket which arrived swiftly. Very attentive staff A large array of breakfast choice - including dimsum and brain masala (yes i ate both) - but if someone is looking for a more standard fare of eggs and toast they seemed to have plenty of options there too The coffee at breakfast was good and exacty what I asked for and came shortly after asking for it.

Food is really tasty especially Handi Biryani. Whenever I visit karachi. Avari is only place is would love to stay. If Avari is full jam packed then trust me i would prefer to stay on streets rather then staying in any other hotel. I recommend whoever is seeking stay in hotels of karachi.

Typically the duration of stay is between 2 weeks to 6 weeks at a stretch.   This hotel is located pretty much in the heart of the city and because of the layout the building is far from the roads, providing secure buffer zone in case of civil disturbance.  The facility is very clean and well maintained by experienced staff under the leadership of the GM Gordon definitely a friendly guy and willing to serve the guests.   These guys take great care of the guests, starting from the security to every need one might have in a foreign land.

Jim B,"One expects high standards of cleanliness, rooms, food and service at a hotel of this reputation.  Karachi's Avari Towers goes even a step farther than anticipated, however.  This is particularly evident in the outstanding security arrangments and a highly visible Scottish General Manager who has time for everyone. The staff is just unparalleled!  I have been to all of the inhabited continents and Avari Towers has made an indelible impression.  This is the gateway to the softer side of Pakistan.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Aamir D,"Me and my family were on a 2 day stay at Avari Towers ,Karachi.We found the hotel staff and the accommodation first class and could not fault the service in any way; the reception desk staff (Mr Mujeeb & Mr Durrani) , Health club staff ( Mr. Aman & Mr Saeed) and Restaurant staff especially Mr. Asif (Sky grill) were always most pleasant and only too willing to help and advise us, which made our stay all the more enjoyable.  Mr. Gordon , the GM, is a gem of a professional with tremendous passion to deliver service excellence and his leadership was strongly felt within his team which profoundly exhibited the same persona .  Mr. Gordon, I would like to thank you and the Avari Karachi team again, for making our stay with your hotel a FANTASTIC  and Memorable one and will certainly…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
benmychree,"I was there for 5 days on a business trip in early March.  The GM Gordon Gorman was in reception and gave me a tour.  I wondered if it was coincidental he was in the lobby when I arrived, but during my stay I discovered how he goes about his work.  He is not one of those managers who just sits in his office all day - he is everywhere all day, checking that everything is running smoothly and up to scratch, advising and encouraging staff etc.  That is why service levels are as they are - superb.  The staff have totally bought into his ethos, and the service throughout my stay was just faultless, better than anything I have had anywhere in the world.  Mr Gorman deserves enormous credit for the hotel's standards.  The rooms are a little dated, and the hotel is going through a…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Zach M,"Gordon, the GM was on well deserved leave and all i can say is that even without his charming presence his team went out of their way to treat you like family. Mr Khan (Asst. Guest services manager) and Mr Durrani (Guest Director) were on hand to ensure the best service possible.  i spend half my life in hotels in Africa and The Middle East, normally with the IHG group but nothing comes close to the attention to detail experienced at Avari Towers.   My room was simply fantastic and thank you again Gordon, you have clearly ensured that your team hold you in high regard and look after your clients as you would.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Dan T,"Going to Karachi, I had three main concerns. Safety, cleanliness and food. All of which were well handled by Avari! I went there on business and stayed for a week. The structure itself is good, the room is spacious and well lite. Wifi & wired internet are free and decent. Big and comfortable bed, along with a comfortable ""lazy boy"" style chair. A small desk to work and a nice LCD TV right in the middle. House keeping was good, and room service was great. You have plenty of food options, whether at the many restaurants or room service. Staff were welcoming and most of them spoke decent English. Security around the hotel was very comforting. There's even an army barrack right across the street. Overall, good experience. I would definitely stay there if I'm ever in Karachi again...…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

I was given an upgrade to a business class room which is truly excellent. The bed is very comfortable, huge choice of pilows a also available. Room is clean and well maintained. Work area is good and wifi is free and reasonably fast. I used rom service several times and food was always quickly delivered, tasty and well-priced. The hotel has a number of excellent restaurants.

Apapanac,"I have been ""putting up with"" international travel for 43 years so I tend to approach hotels with a bit of ""oh, not another one"" feeling  - but I reckon it is impossible to arrive at the Avari and feel remotely like this.  I have stayed there for over two thousand dollars' worth of Pakistan Multiple entry visas and absolutely look forward to returning. The staff, watched over by a Scottish eagle by the name of Gordon Gorman, are, without exception, superb, the rooms immaculate, the security as good as it gets, the services impeccable and the food in all restaurants fresh, beautifully presented and as good as you will find anywhere (the tempura prawns in Fujiyama alone make a visit worthwhile).   I guess the motto should be ""arrive as a guest and leave as a family member"" - it…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

GarethTW,"I am staying at the Avari Towers Hotel in Karachi and have been most impressed by the staff who have gone out of their way to be helpful. I arrived at around 10am after an arduous delayed journey, having had no sleep overnight. I was greeted with a refreshing drink and minimal waiting to be registered. An early check-in was provided within half an hour, so that I could begin to unpack and unwind. The Duty Manager, Mr Faisal Rehman, could not have been more helpful in enabling me to deal with contractual papers that had to be signed and copied and returned to enable me to undertake some work here in Pakistan. There is a large outdoor pool, which is well maintained, albeit the water during the day was about 34 degrees C. All in all, this has proved to be a perfect place to stay,…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

The room assigned to me was a small room and not a bad one but just that I'm a little uncomfortable in small spaces. I requested another room to be assigned to me.

Asaad Shaikh,"I regularly play tennis at Avari and after since i have come under coaching with Nomi Qamar, my game has evolved tremendously. Every good tennis player doesn't mean he/she is a good at coach as well. I would like to appreciate the choice that Avari made of Nomi as he is a very good player and a great coach as well.

Dr Ghulam Nabi Kazi,"Ever since, I moved to Islamabad in 2005, Avari Towers has remained by hotel of choice during my visits to Karachi for any purpose. I have some very close relatives in Karachi, but as I am mostly here on official business, I opt to stay here to have fewer distractions. The hotel is continuously improving its services and amenities and is lucky to have very professional staff, which is always prepared to be very kind, courteous and always eager to troubleshoot any minor issues. Whether its the front desk, any restaurant or the room itself, everything appears to be properly supervised and monitored. Its always like coming home. Another reason for my liking is that while I was married in Avari Lahore, I had my wedding reception in Avari Karachi during 1990. I would like to say a…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

If you are travelling for business or leisure my recommendation is Avari.

The services were excellent and so the environment. I enjoyed a lot and if I get a chance to visit Karachi again, I would definitely visit Avari Hotel. The Barbecue was yummmy and believe me I order it daily. The Paratha they served in breakfast was awesome. I could not get enough. I am recommending it you guys. It is a worth visiting place.",5,Avari Towers Karachi

I'm not big on BBQ, but the ability to sit on a roof top, 17th floor, after all the noise and dust of Karachi and watch the night pass by is too much to miss. The food was excellent, service a bit overly ""there"". The mutton curry and the BBQ was so delicious. It was in 1997 in PK that I had such a nice BBQ. The next surprise was the breakfast buffet. Sure its great, but I had the best coffee that I've had anywhere except in Europe.   Ok, back to the hotel. Rooms are great. Central location. Very friendly and supportive staff. Priced a bit higher than some others, but that was ok. The Chinese restaurant is supposed to be the best in…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

The service levels of the staff are so professional and the food is amazing.  The hotel has a lovely pool  gym, spa, barber and meeting rooms.  The 'Business Class' rooms could be re-branded to 'First Class' easily, they are very comfortable, wonderful facilities and fast internet.    My opinion - don't shop around.  Book this hotel and you will be amazed.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Adrian S,"Stayed at Avari Towers first week in April and found it very pleasant and a haven of calmness from the manic state of the business environment in Karachi. The rooms and facilities at Avari are first class, wifi is one of best in any Pak hotel I stayed and the food is exceptional, especially the roof top BBQ. Only downside of hotel is ageing gym equipment. Best security of any Karachi hotel and on site car hire made my business schedule smooth. Airport transfers are efficient at Avari something which is very important for most foreign travellers arriving in Karachi. The staff are friendly and always willing to assist. I did see some local visitors complaining about problems with their stay, but not my experience. AA+. Cheers Adrian.",4,Avari Towers Karachi

Far superior than these hotels in room quality, hotel staff service and home like serene atmosphere. In-house Dynasty restaurant is #1 Chinese restaurant in Pakistan. The rooms are recently refurbished so give a look and feel of a new hotel. However, the rooms are small so ask for a Suite, which are available in all categories starting World Traveller, the lowest fare room. The extra space and additional furniture makes the suite an ideal for long stay.

At our reporting time only two tables were occupied by two foreigners (may be their in-house guests). We were taken to our already reserved table. and then to the buffet where different types of Steaks were displayed. My husband chose Fillet Mignon and I selected T-bone. While our Steaks were cooked we went to the Salad counter which was awesome.  Our Steaks arrived with the grilled tomatoes. We took Mashed Potatoes and Spinach Creme with sauteed Vegetables.

Despite currently staying in the Penthouse suite & taking 2 further rooms in this expensive hotel, there is no understanding of the word 'service' - we have been so disturbed by this that we are looking to move out after only one night! Just a few irritations: reservation incorrect (only 3 beds for family of 5), staff told our guests today that our Christmas lunch booking had been cancelled but it hadn't, room service took 1.5hrs to come & they told us 30mins, etc. The management need to take responsibility for this frustrating, disappointing and unnecessary experience.",1,Avari Towers Karachi

Ahmed H,"I recently visited Karachi on an official business and stayed in Avari Towers Hotel. Unfortunately, I forgot a few of my belongings in the room I stayed in and realized this only upon my return to Islamabad. Although, I had thought of calling the hotel management for retrieving my belongings - which are valuable to me - but, I was surprised to receive a call from an official of the hotel - Miss Taniya Khan informing me that the hotel was holding the things I had forgotten in my room.  I am all praise for the Avari Towers Hotel management, for their dedication to service and honesty, and am especially very impressed by the courteous behavior of Miss Taniya Khan. She has proven that she is worthy of the trust that the hotel management has reposed in her. I wish Miss Taniya Khan a…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Furhan,"What used to be one of the best hotels in Karachi has clearly met its downfall.  I've stayed here numerous times on work trips, and have kept giving Avari the benefit of the doubt, hoping complaints to the management would make things better. It's not working and this review has to be written.   An hour ago, before I could finally fall asleep after a tiring day, I ended up jumping out of bed, horrified, seeing a bedbug making its way towards me. For the price of this hotel, this is the worst complimentary offering one can get.   I killed the bug, took a picture (attached), and went downstairs to complain to the night manager who immediately called the staff to change the sheets and clean the room.

Khan,"Our recent stay at Avari was Superbbbb! We enjoyed every minute staying there. It was probably our 50th stay with them but this time they made it special for us.. to my surprise while checking in, we were upgraded to their 'Penthouse' on the 15th floor though we had a booking for the ‘Residence Suite’ which is also very nice and our usual room preference. The staff were friendly, courteous, and helpful like always. And the ‘Penthouse’ we stayed in, took our breaths away when we entered and we just burst with excitement as we had never stayed in such a nice room before. The ‘Penthouse’ was just perfect there was dining area sitting/lounge area and a very nice bedroom, a small Kitchenette and a beautiful view to the city. It was cosy and classy.  We were served on-the-house snacks…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Turysta20144,"I really like the ambience of this hotel, it has such relaxed atmosphere! The pool has warm water and is not very busy- another bonus point. The hotel is slightly dated, and some facilities could be improved. If I am ever back in Karachi I will definitely stay here again, the hotel staff are very accommodating and they will go the extra mile to assist the guests. I really cannot fault any of them- reception, restaurant , pool staff- all just great! I had a dinner at the roof top and I really liked it, breakfast was also good but it did not change too much on a daily basis as such for me this could be a problem if I had to stay longer as I really do not like eating the same food day in day out.

It was a great experience and shout out to all employees for excellent customer care, particularly, Atul Roy in Asia Live Restaurant for extending great service and front desk staff, Rashna, Malcolm and Sadaf for their polite demeanor and resolving issues that I encountered.  There were some glitches though such as, request to change the room booking from single to double was not updated in the computer system and an upgrade to Business Room due to length of our stay as promised by Tehzeeb Fatima did not happen.

MikaelBjorn,"Avari Towers in Karachi was one of the first luxury hotels ever built in the city which gives the hotel a certain air of dignity and prestige.   I got very fond of the hotel right away from the minute I saw it and entered it. However, the note that driver were holding at the airport was really tiny - so for next time I'd like to give the hotel some piece of advice and that is to direct the driver to always use a paper or document with the hotel guests names in big capital letters so they can more easily spot and detect the driver taking them to the hotel.  I like the strong security awareness in the hotel - nothing is left for granted. Ground staff are very friendly and really goes that extra mile to please their guests.

Aneela K,My husband and I stayed for 2 months in Avari Towers karachi with our newborn daughter. The best part of the stay was the excellent service provided by our diligent and dedicated cleaning guy Mohammad Hanif. He took good care of us for our entire stay (see photo)  Biggest disappointment was that I ordered a Xmas cake to take to a friend’s party. They prepared a 2 kg cake but at the last minute told me they did not have an appropriate box to transport it in!!! And couldn’t find a solution. Had to abandon the cake and go empty handed to my friend’s house  The GM Mr. Olivier Français was very gracious and made our stay more comfortable,3,Avari Towers Karachi
Saman T,The housekeeping staff at Avari Towers were so professional and were able to help our family out as we needed!

The check in time took me only two minutes after my arrival which was amazing and same was at the time of check out.  Regarding the SOPs of COVID19, Avari has taken excellent measures.

She also guided me regarding my payments. Through her excellent services, I had checked in my room in less than 10minutes since I reached the hotel. She made sure that my room was immaculate and also called me multiple times during my stay to make sure my stay was comfortable and that if I needed anything, she would get it arranged.

The rooms are the best among the five star hotels I have ever stayed in Karachi. The hotel is located in the heart of Karachi i.e. Saddar area. It is close by to the main city area, other five star hotels and corporate hub of Karachi, but is unfortunately far from Karachi Airport. The best thing I like about the hotel is beautiful rooms, quality service, health club and dining halls. In addition the location of the hotel is ideal if you have business in the corporate hub of the city or you want to enjoy the historical areas, shopping and beach of the city. Say what you liked best & least",5,Avari Towers Karachi

We have Gold status and requested an early check-in. Approximately 75 minutes after our arrival the room was available. The standard room was adequate but small.

The hotel has a lot of different restaurants which offer a wide range of international food, there's also a japanes restaurant and a bbq on the top floor. They also have a 24hrs in-room-dining-service (irds), which I tried already and have to admit, that this one is the best so far, and I have been to Bangkok, Shanghai, San Francisco, New York and other major cities and hotels. The irds here is top of my list.

Since we had our event at Avari's we got one day stay at the wedding suite complimentary/free. Overall, we enjoyed our stay on all days. The service was pretty good. Food was the best thing there, we liked everything we ordered including Avari burger, club sandwich, breadbasket, etc. The only downside was the AC in the standard room, it was not cooling enough but the wedding suite was just perfect. For the wedding reception, we got the venue for free since we availed the deal that involved booking the venue prior to August 1, 2020. The food was spot on.

Salim H,I  usually stay at another 5 star property close to Avari but was amazed at the quality of the hotel when I made a switch  to try a new property.  Superb staff and great breakfasts.  The afternoon tea is sumptuous and of amazing variety.  Shanti a host at the afternoon tea is superb.  Front office staff are excellent  and Humera at check-in is outstanding...great can-do attitude and ability to help.  Clean rooms and great property.  A few extra drawers for the clothes and some space in the bathrooms for toiletries would have been useful.  The architect went for fancy tiles and glitzy bathroom looks at the expense of function.  However the quality of the staff and property make up for all the fuss of inadequate places to put things.,5,Avari Towers Karachi

More bbq choices would have been better..! A great variety of sweet selections, they had live music as well which we enjoyed very much!  My only complaint is that the food was not spicy at all and the gol grappas shell in appetizer were stale.  Overall good atmosphere and friendly staff! ",4,Avari Towers Karachi

I must say the staff at reception is really helpful and very courteous, they go out of the way to meet the needs. The staff from Lahore Mr Farhan (Director Revenue) was very kind to help us make bookings and accommodate us. Ms Humaira at reception was very kind to meet and greet us on check in day.  The rooms were clean, but the only issue we faced were Washrooms, they were glass cabins, kind of uncomfortable  with family around. A suggestion they should be made with solid partition for privacy. Will definitely stay again.",5,Avari Towers Karachi

I must say, after living in Karachi for almost 40years, Avari certainly helped me see this city from the eyes of a tourist.

Centrally located, the guest experience starts from Ms. Rachna’s broad smile and welcome at guest relations to the Fujiyama manager ( forgot his name !) accommodating  my whims enthusiastically. Wish they have lobster in stock next time, but Unagi saved  the day! Buffet breakfast is cool with more emphasis on continental choices than I’ve seen elsewhere (egg Benedict’s can be improved )    Pool was nicely relaxing with chilled beverages and evening breeze - combo that I don’t  get in Lahore.  Still cannot get over all that marble in suite rooms !  ",4,Avari Towers Karachi

Blueheron5,"It's always a pleasure to stay at a hotel where they really get the customer service right. The Avari Towers staff all seemed genuinely welcoming and helpful which made my week long stay feel very pleasant. The breakfast buffets offered a very varied selection of options to cater for every taste, the Chinese restaurant on the lower ground floor is excellent (though quite expensive). The pool area is relaxing and a welcome oasis in a busy city that was experiencing temperatures of 40C in April. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.

To our great delight we discovered that we had been upgraded from a basic room to a wonderful suite.   Most of our dealings were with reception and in particular we were hugely impressed by Ms. Nargis and Ms Rashna.  We are also thankful to  Asad Masoor, Ms. Farwa and Mr Junaid for their kind attention. The dining room staff were also attentive and kind, but too many to name.   We enjoyed the wide ranging buffet breakfast and also dinner.   Security was thorough but lightly handled.    We enjoyed a couple of walks to the nearby bazaar and had absolutely no difficulty.  The same was our experience in touring Karachi.  Delighted to have…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

He also told me that he knew that my family member had brought her own iron. I was shocked beyond belief that he had gone into the room and noticed what possessions they had!!!

I want to give a special shout out to Duty Manager ASAD MASOOD who always goes out of his way to be helpful towards his guests. He has checked us in the last two times we have stayed at the hotel. He was very friendly and cooperative. Since we were there for a wedding, we had a lot of luggage and he was nice enough to upgrade us to the Business rooms so we could have more space.

Hammad,"The Sky BBQ at Avari Karachi has a great spot in the heart of the city but pathetic food quality and service. The food is mostly stale and might make you sick.   If nothing else be prepared to be throw up once you find hair in your food.   This place offers a Pakistani buffet. Trust me this should be your last stop in the city for authentic Pakistani food. It is over priced and clearly unhygienic. Table drapes are torn or discoloured. Cutlery is greasy and unclean. Food serving area has inadequate light. Since it is in the open, there is a chance of insects crawling into the serving dishes.    I wouldn’t trust Avari with hygiene or quality control.   Verdict: - Try other spots in Karachi for authentic Pakistani buffet.  - Their food also has high levels of Monosodium glutamate…",1,Avari Towers Karachi
A Tauqir,"PIA cancelled their 7:00 pm flight to Karachi and I was urgently booked on Serene Air for 10:00 pm. My stay was booked at the Avari Towers where I had already stayed for a few times and my experience was okay. The deluxe rooms, I believe, are too small and somehow the staff insists solo travelers to agree for a room with single beds, whereas, their single beds are too small and uncomfortable to sleep on.  Anyhow, I reached the hotel around 12:30 midnight and the first room given to me was NOT EVEN CLEANED after being in use of the previous guest.  The bed linen was VISIBLY dirty, had hair all over the pillow covers and makeup stains on the sheets. When I asked the bell boy that this room is not clean and has a distinct stench, he didn't agree at all. But when I proceeded to…",1,Avari Towers Karachi

M.Sohaib,"I personally find the location of Avari towers convenient considering my nature of work.  The check in was pleasant and smooth but they need to increase staff at front desk.  Rooms were clean and tidy. I am allergic to dust and smoke, and I didn't feel discomfort while staying there. The floor was non smoking.  Food serving is equally good and perfect, I wanted to order steak but they refused to serve me around 2300 hours.  I ordered mutton which was fine and tasty. ",4,Avari Towers Karachi

Rizwanmumtaz,"I am usually satisfied with very little but the meal at this place deserved some spanking. The dude basically walks you through the bbq section asking you what could they prepare you from the stock of over marinated meat, chicken and fish. And with some magic, serves that bbq in less than 5 min. obviously not freshly done. They also overload your plate wasting a lot of food. The curries are not fresh. And the loud live music doesnt really make it a cosy place to sit and talk to your folks.  I would rather want to be some place else and enjoy good taste then a panaromic view.  God bless these people.",1,Avari Towers Karachi

Took our dinner at dynasty ( one of the restaurants in Avari ) it’s a Chinese restaurant. Great taste with brilliant ambience. Have already done dinner at fujiyama (a Japanese restaurant) it also had a very vast and awesome variety of Japanese food. ( must try for sushi lovers ).

Phone did not work either when calling outside the hotel, but nobody cared to solve it. Room fittings are outdated and in need of a facelift. No electricity plugs near the bed. No access to the balcony, door is locked and balcony not maintained.  ATMs in the hotel do not accept foreign cards (Master,  Maestro). Front desk service was not satisfactory.

Carol T,My first time at the Avari Towers in Karachi started well. We were greeted with a welcome drink and the advised our room had been upgraded. We were travelling with work colleagues who were in a suite. The entrance hall was decorated nicely for Christmas. The room was disappointing - for an upgraded room it was clean and fresh but nothing other than ordinary. In fact it lacked some of the basics such as a hairdryer. Even our colleagues in the suite had tor request a hairdryer and ironing board. The hotel is in the midst of being refurbished and it certainly needs it to bring its' standard up. There were some good points - the view from the window was amazing - we were on the 16th floor and we were slightly late for breakfast but they still provided it to us. Would not be enough…,2,Avari Towers Karachi

On a positive note I must say that the air conditioning was superb and the room clean.   The windows were caked in dust from a neighbouring construction site, which my room overlooked.

It’s a lovely hotel with relaxed environment and extremely friendly staff, special Ms.Sadaf, Humera at the front desk, Mr, Farooq and Skuntalla from house keeping and breakfast supervisor and rest of her staff.

mcherrill,A first-class hotel in an excellent location. Excellent staff. Room was in a quiet part of the hotel in the 'business floor' and was very comfortable. Breakfast was good with a range of cuisines to choose from. Settled for simple yoghurts and peelable fruits. A variety of bread and rolls on offer too.  Small bar on the 10th floor was very accommodating. The rooftop barbecue was pretty amazing. Asian cuisine restaurant downstairs but didn't try this. Japanese restaurant on the top floor too with excellent food. Very pleased with my stay.,5,Avari Towers Karachi

Particularly during the times of Covid-19 and lockdown situation, we wanted a place which would be safe for guests to gather and celebrate this with us. When we got to know that hotels are taking in bookings for such events, we really did not think much and went ahead to see if Avari is possible. We have always heard very nice reviews about it, so did not think much in choosing where to hold such an important event of our lives. We knew that this place is a no-brainer when it comes to holding such events. I am highly satisfied with the way the team dealt with us.

hasan_matloob83,"Its one of the better hotels in the city of Karachi. It has everything what you expect in a 4 star property. Room was neat and tidy. Air conditioning was working and was very effective. Washroom was clean. Wifi was working smoothly. Food was being served inside the rooms due to COVID. It was freshly cooked and delicious.   My only criticism would be the size of the bed. It is a bit small for taller guys (like myself). However it was comfortable so atleast one can have a good sleep. Also, the washrooms don't have a bathtub which is strange as most of the 4 star properties do have bathtubs installed in washrooms.",4,Avari Towers Karachi

We needed to stay close to the center and chose Avari towers as it’s an iconic hotel of Karachi and we both hold childhood memories of going past the hotel and wondering what it would be like. We were met by our hotel shuttle driver holding my name card as soon we came out of the airport arrivals building.

CoolDude2012,"This is a very decent upmarket hotel, with all the amenities you could need. The breakfast buffet is superb, even with sushi.  Lots of guns and security. There is a Hertz and small shop in the complex.  The rooms are big, and enough space to spread out. There is a safe, desk, chair, hairdryer, iron, ironing board, and decent sony tv.   Where it falls short is on the QUALITY of the sleep: The pillows are like rocks. They clearly are old, and there is not enough variety, nor enough of them. The sheets are cheap, and not soft as you would expect for an upmarket hotel.  Each room on the even side faces what looks like a GIANT set of vents alongside hotel generators, and the noise from them is unbearable. Even putting ear plugs in doesn't help as the vents vibrate. This spoilt my…",3,Avari Towers Karachi

We finally got to reception and met Mohammed the night receptionist who checked us in and gave us the keys to both of the rooms we had booked.  The room was a double room and the bed sheets and bathroom were dirty and it stunk of cigarettes considering it was a non smoking room.  Mohammed was very efficient and changed our room immediately.

24Ash,My stay with Avari was for a week and initially had a bad start with delayed check in and major congestion at the reception area as the lobby is a bit on the smaller side when compared to other hotels of similar stature . Thereafter the internet speeds in the room were just so slow that each time I had to do some work (which was crucial office work) I had to come down to the lobby area despite my complaints to the reception staff for 2 days continuous. Eventually the IT manager arranged a special router with a separate password which then resolved the issue. Apparently that part of the building had issues with the wifi router. In any event the IT manager whose name I cant recall did his part to get my connection stable so kudos to him. Other staff worth mentioning is the front…,4,Avari Towers Karachi

Kaleem A,"Unfortunately we were so disappointed by our first day's experience we moved out, instead of spending the full 9 days at the hotel.  Avari is in desperate need of refurbishment. It holds a strong reputation in Karachi as one of the best hotels, however, it does not provide good value for money at all. Especially for a 5 star accommodation.  We were in two rooms, 915 and 916. Both rooms had different and distinct smells of mold, sewage and smoke. They were sub standard with heavily worn bed side tables, scribbles on the walls, sticky and dirty bed side phones, mold and layers of dust caked on the air conditioning vents, rusted screws in the bathroom and a ripped and dirty carpet in both rooms. I would not walk around barefoot in the room at all.   I did not have high…",1,Avari Towers Karachi

John G,"Second visit to Karachi for my wife and I and we stayed at the Avari Towers again. We were treated as returning family, as the staff remembered us from our previous visit (it's nice to get that personal touch at a hotel). The GM and his staff were friendly and always helpful. Great restaurants also! The Chinese restaurant is great. The Japanese was closed due to Ramazan, but having eaten there before, we highly recommend it. The breakfast buffet is really good, it could put a lot of the big hotel chains to shame with the selection and quality. The rooms are modern and clean (this should be standard but isn't always in Pakistan). The only little quibble that I had was that I found the bed to be a bit on the hard side for me, but otherwise we had a great time there!",5,Avari Towers Karachi

To be fair the rooms were modern and clean but this what I'd expect from a hotel that charges the rates it does.  Of course I'd stay there again but as I said only average from my point of view.,3,Avari Towers Karachi

I struggle with an earlier review I read. I have travelled for years and had many stomach upsets but I have stayed at the Avari three times and never had an issue. This really is an excellent hotel from security through to the excellent Staff (who can not do enough) to the GM who is the best that I have ever come accross. I saw evidence of where he went the extra mile to help people with personal issues. This really is one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed at.,5,Avari Towers Karachi

Armin A,"I had a pleasant stay in Avari Towers during my second trip in Karachi except for some noticeable observations.   I just noticed the deterioration with the hotel facilities and that I stayed in a non-smoking room but I could smell smoke specially around 7-9 pm. I had to transfer room.  I also had a horrifying experience as I got sick during the last 2 weeks of my stay. I got hospitalized for one week when I got back home, finding out that I was infected with salmonella arizonae. I surely hope that I did not get it from the food they serve in the hotel. You cannot discount the idea that I might got it from the hotel  because I only ate at the hotel and seldom ate outside. So for the avari staff make sure that the quality of preparing and serving the food is of high standard.",3,Avari Towers Karachi

Aruba from Avari’s front office team is the one star performer who knows what is all about customer experience. I was staying at avari during my stopover to Europe, and due to some confusion at booking office my hotel reservation was not booked. I was quite worried because of this eleventh hour issue but Aruba made sure and went of the way and sorted everything within 20 mins. Even after this, she also instructed the team to provide superior service to their guest. I was not a fan of Avari but this proactiveness and excellent customer service is the reason I am going rate avari as top rated hotel in the city.",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Asad,"Avari has always been a good experience for me. From the room to the services provided, everything is on-point. There is only one concern I have: They do not allow food from the outside, and their room service is bland and expensive. There shouldn't be any restriction on bringing outside food into the premises, gives the customer a wide range of options to choose from, specially during lockdown where the customer can neither go somewhere to eat, and in Avari's case, not even bring/ get something delivered to their rooms. Other competitors (PC, Marriot etc.) have no such restrictions.",5,Avari Towers Karachi

S Ashraf,"I had organised a small reception for my family members at Avari Tower’s Indus suite on 14 August 2020. It was our first outing since February when everything in Pakistan closed down due to Corona outbreak! We were a little apprehensive but were really relieved to see the excellent SOPs followed by Avari. Their staff were well trained in Corona related SOPs. As usual, very courteous and professional.The setup was flawless. Food was delicious and the food presentation was excellent. The staff were really nice and helpful. I’d like to particularly thank Mr Husnain for visiting the venue despite his off. The venue Manager, Mr Habib has every eye for details and he took care of smallest details.

Abdul Qadir,"I am an old client of Avari and Beach Luxury hotels. I was handled by Ms Nargis at the time of checking in and checking out many times. Even when there were many guests and she was alone at counter , she handled every one very nicely and amicably which is really commendable and impressive ! I saw many guests who were not polite with her as rooms were not ready for them but she handled them very politely and professionally. I think she has lots of marketting capabilities and talent that is why always calm and polite with customers. I wish her all the best and success !",5,Avari Towers Karachi

OAlvi,"I stayed at Avari for a couple of nights this month. The stay was pleasant and very comfortable. The amenities were perfect. Great stay if you're in Karachi.   Took away one star for three things. Firstly, the WiFi was a bit spotty at night. Secondly, they give you two small water bottles a day. If you need more, you'll have to purchase them. They should at least provide large water bottles. Lastly, the room was freezing at even the lowest air conditioning setting so I had to turn it off. The fridge, however, is connected to the air conditioning so if you turn it off, the fridge will turn off as well. Didn't bother me, but just something to know. All in all, it was a great stay.",4,Avari Towers Karachi

After a terrible day and night in PC, we had the good fortune of staying at Avari. Hotels in Karachi were generally experiencing a high volume of guests. But the check in at Avari was super smooth. Mr. Khurram at the front desk greeted us gleefully and checked us in. Our check in was super smooth and quick - within 15 mins we were in our room. The rooms were impeccably clean and equipped With all luxuries one can expect of a prestigious property like Avari. The bathrooms are luxurious and stunning.

Fuat E.,"A kind of hotel that thinks your needs, specially with your bathroom stuff, doesn't matter if you forget anything to bring, you can find everything in the bathroom menu, shaving equipment, toothbrushes etc, everything. Has a pillow menu for uncomfortable people, a nice bed, really good airconditioning, have a good large screen lcd tv, quite large rooms and they can find you anything you require as cigarettes etc. if you make the reservation for a standard room and they don't have it left, than they give you a higher level room with the same price and the hotel stuff all speaks english and they were willing to help you without you ask. the only bad thing was the balcony door was locked for security reasons. anyway, it worths the money you pay.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
richardbate,"Anyone who's been to Karachi knows that it can be frustration on earth. Anarchic traffic, bureaucracy coming out of every pore, and frustration at every turn - that's how it can seem. Avari Towers really is a haven away from all that. I even heard a well-known TV journalist describe it as ""home from home.""  Maybe it's because it's owned by an enlightened business family, perhaps it's got something to do with the fact that the GM is a Scot who lives in Thailand. Whatever - it works. This is THE place to stay in Karachi if you are a visitor. The hotel has an authentic Japanese restaurant, a Chinese restaurant with a real Chinese chef, a roof-top open air barbecue terrace, and Asia Live - the ""coffee shop.""

CliveGerrard,"As stated by previous reviewers, the Avari Towers is a very safe and secure hotel. An important factor in our choice of hotel in such a place as Karachi. My colleagues and I were traveling to Karachi on business for approximately four days.  We were made to feel very welcome. The service and staff were excellent and the quality of the rooms and facilities in the hotel, first rate.  The only downer was the state of the swimming pool, which looked like it needed a good scrub. However, that did not detract from the overall quality of the hotel.   I was particularly impressed by the lady in charge of customer services, who was helpful and friendly without being intrusive. I was particularly taken by the complementary iced cinnamon tea served in the lounge of the same name, and only…",5,Avari Towers Karachi

Upon our arrival, we were bumped up to a nicer room, and that was highly appreciated. The rooms are very modern with Wifi in the rooms. The beds are comfortable, and there is even a service where you can order the types of pillows you prefer (e.g. if you like firm pillows, you can place an order for them, and the staff will bring them up free of charge). There is free 500ml bottles of water provided each day for brushing your teeth and drinking (which is extremely nice as you can’t drink the sink water in Pakistan, and you can’t even brush your teeth with it).   The breakfast is also very, very good. There are a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies along with an entire…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Travel_Genius,"I agee with other reviewers about the apparent security of the hotel.  Also on the plus side the breakfast buffet was as good as I've had just about anywhere, and the no charge in-room wireless internet was much appreciated.  However, the standard rooms are very ""tired"" and in desperate need of an upgrade. At check-in the reception offered a higher standard (recently upgraded) room, though at a substantial price premium.  It is Karachi, so one takes what they can, though you don't have to be thrilled about it.",3,Avari Towers Karachi

When I tried to collect my advance payment, the clerk tried to gave me less than what I paid as he was hoping I will not count. When I counted and I told him that they owe me more. He then gave me my full payment. I will never stay in this hotel and it is not worth even a $100.  I always stay in Pearl Continental.",1,Avari Towers Karachi

Try their new 'Business Class' with it's many benefits. Just as a country is it's people, a hotel is it's staff - and they don't get better than at the Avari Towers. They combine warmth and friedliness with efficiency and a strong desire to ensure your needs are fully cared for. In the current atmosphere, security is paramount  and it is taken very seriously. From the entrance you pass through two checks before getting into the hotel - and they do check, even if they have seen you several times before. The rooms, as you would expect in a 5-star hotel are clean, spacious and well maintained. The buffet breakfast, the only meal I took inside the…",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Grahampm,"This is quite a secure hotel as it has a long entrance ramp secured at street level, and it's not as well known for western guests as some others in Karachi. The rooms were nice, the view is good.   We got great service from hotel staff, and the food was OK. As usual I didn't get to use the pool. I seem to recall it was better value than where I normally stay  too (the Pearl), and I'll go back there again.",4,Avari Towers Karachi
AG A,"They need to learn on ""communications""... out of the 4 days we stayed there, every single time we placed an order on room service, we always expected the order to be ""Different"" or incomplete.

Paid premium rates as demand was high, but definitely disappointed with service in return  Rooms were cleaned to an average standard daily without basic provisions being replenished. Had to phone twice to ask for towels and toiletries. Breakfast was pleasant surprise, as was Chinese. Despite having 4 lifts, only max of 2 worked, meaning long waits. Staff do try in honesty, but lack training in 5 star hospitality reqd. Location was good",3,Avari Towers Karachi

Although it had blinds but didn't make any sense. The bathroom door didn't close properly neither. Still trying to figure out the quantity and variety of the pillows. Apart from breakfast at Asia Live, mostly but ordered room service from their restaurants. The portions were huge, well enough for two people. Overall I found it to be a bit pricey.  NOTE: Alcohol is available to foreign passport holders.",4,Avari Towers Karachi

I am thankful to the management for upgrading us from the standard rooms to Business class room. In 13 days we used almost all the services provided by the hotel.  Especially the laundry, we always looked for urgent services from them and they were very efficient always and never said no to us.

Having said that, this property is old and feels old despite being told about a recent refurbishment.  The shower heads are full of lime scale that could easily be removed but it's not. I had to ask for pillows to be replaced because the covers had stains. The bed and room functions are fine except that the lamp on the desk is half the size of the desk so you can't quite get comfortable if trying to work.

What is meant to be a ""luxury 5* hotel"" is actually one of the poorest standard hotels and a disgrace to the luxury hotel category. The room we were given was covered in dust; dust bunnies on the floor and the bed had clearly been made quite a while before  our visit as the duvet was so dusty. The clock in the room displayed the wrong time, the toiletries were so poor; not even a toothpaste, body wash or conditioner in sight. The breakfast was extremely disappointing, offering very poor options. The pancakes were small store bought pancakes, they only offered one fresh juice, very limited cereals and the staff would take so long to get something for us.

Security is also good and i always felt safe here.   I have only 1 minus point to mention: The room cards are just working for 1 or 2 days. That’s a bit annoying when you come back from a hard day at work looking forward to get in your room and then the key doesn’t work.  Some staff i would like to mention is:  1) Arif from 10th floor Business lounge. I would say he is really one of the best staff in this hotel. Thanks Arif. 2) Miss Shanti from room service. She is…,4,Avari Towers Karachi
Ali S,"Had a pleasant stay at Avari hotel, Karachi. The room was spacious and peaceful. There was a work desk with the power station to charge your devices. Internet in the room was slightly slow.

I stayed in the business class room which was very comfortable...clean and spacious...the wireless Internet is very good probably best in Pakistan, I was very easily about,etc to login to my office and work remotely when needed at the same time was skyping with my kids. Good choices of restaurants available...great midnight snacks from room service.

Colin W,"I have been traveling to Karachi on business for over 10 years, and during this time I have stayed at all the international hotels and many of the better local establishments. The Avari Towers hotel, however, has become my hotel of choice. In fact I spent more than 200 days there during 2011-12. The affable Scotsman who runs the establishment (Gordon) and his team do a splendid job, and nothing is too much trouble. Security measures are first rate and I always feel 100% safe. There is a Japanese, Chinese and 2 local restaurants. The food quality is high and prices reasonable. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and with a recent refit still in good nick. The pool area and gym are just ok. I would highly recommend this hotel to other travelers.",4,Avari Towers Karachi
Alrajwani,"The Avari is a lovely hotel with very good security, newly redone rooms including a very nice lounge on the 10th floor.  Food at all their restaurants is very good - I particularly like the BBQ Rooftop and Chinese Dynasty.  Service is also superb.  Great place to stay when conducting business in Pakistan.",5,Avari Towers Karachi
Pascal,"Good and safe (this is key in Karachi) hotel with two very good restaurants for Pakistan: a Japanese on the roof top with good, clean sushi and a Chines that deserves the name. Excellent staff, internationally experienced management. Not for holidays, of course, but a perfect business hotel, and much better and safer than the internationally known hotels in town. Stayed there some 15 times and would not stay anywhere else in Karachi.",4,Avari Towers Karachi
UmutA,Avari is a good hotel with a very good security. Food in the restaurants are also very deligious and clean. I have stayed there as a VIP guest and service was excellent. The staff were always wandering around me in case I may need anything... Nice lobby and nice rooms.,4,Avari Towers Karachi
OregonianinPatan,"I have stayed at the Avari three times, for 2-5 days each.  As a western woman traveling alone I found the Avari to be welcoming, secure and very comfortable.  The staff is friendly and focused on meeting the needs of the guests. The recently remodeled rooms are spacious and designed for both relaxation and taking care of computer or paperwork.  The restaurants offer a variety of cuisines, each with great food and service.  The buffet breakfast is a nice way to start the day, and the rooftop restaurant is a delicious experience under the stars.  The quality of the hotel is a reflection of a marriage between excellent management and the warmth and professionalism of the Pakistani staff.  Whenever I am in Karachi I will stay at the Avari.",4,Avari Towers Karachi
RichardB564,"There are lots of reasons for not staying in hotels owned by large international chains in Pakistan, but the very best reason is the existence of the Avari hotels. The Avari Karachi (like its sister hotel in Lahore) is secure, friendly, comfortable and thoughtful in all that it does.  Delightful staff and a management team that not only cares about the guests' comforts, but does not seek to squeeze every additional penny from that guest for all the thoughtful services provided. Great restaurants, great service and a great hotel. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",5,Avari Towers Karachi

apjdw,Was booked in on a night stay.   1. Location: The hotel is in a xommercial market which means plenty of cheap places to eat/a couple of small shops. The entrance to the hotel is on the back side of the building hidden behind a parking lot and unmarked. It took me a whole lap around the block to find it.  2. Front desk staff (Ahmed) and bellboys were all very welcoming. Check in was smooth and efficient. Only one elevator in the place.  3. The building itself is old though it does appear to have been renovated in 2017 or so. Rooms still open with keys. The age of furniture was very evident. Thankfully the bedding was clean and spotless. Room tv was working. No minibar but 2 water bottles and an electric kettle were provided. Ample closet space and electric sockets in the room.…,4,"Hotel One Jinnah, Islamabad"

And no one was at the lobby. The second time i came with my husband and it was a horrible experience. 3 times change of bedroom, bugs all over and no response. And the air conditiores was so low (it couldnt be fixed)  i got sick of my throat. I was going to be be out for 5 months and this was our honeymoon and they ruined it. Restaurant was closed and i cant tolerate spicy food so this turned into a nightmare to me. No solutions i just cant eat anything for 4 days. All the food is overprocessed, oversweet and super spicy and i cant eat that. I would die. I will never come back and surely i will…",1,Beach Luxury Hotel

The french fries were consistently served stale as well as other items served by pool side, th chicken wings were still raw from th inside. The pool would be nicer If they knocked down the one foot wall to make it look like an infinty pool. Service overall was good. We do wish the hotel window didn't have a gigantic ugly aluminium frame running through the middle, a giant one or two piece glass window would.hwve been great as that aluminum bar in the middle keeps getting in the way of the fantastic view.

Imad K,it wasn't that good of an experience overall.  Ordered a king size bed but they doubled the single beds and didn't inform of the breakfast in bed which was kinda bad.

Amal Mut,"I had booked the Beach Luxury Hotel through Booking.com on the 19th of January 2023 for the dates 11th-15th March as I have a work commitment there. I received an email confirmation then.  Due to flight issues, I sent a message via Booking.com on the 10th of March to the hotel informing them that I will be checking in only on the next day, which they acknowledged.   Then later on that day, I received a notification that my credit card detail was invalid, for which I called Booking.com and the hotel itself to inform them that I have tried another card and to try again. I was told to wait. Later on again, I received another notification saying the same thing. This happened several times despite trying with my husband's credit card and each time I called our banks are reassured that there are no card or banking issues. Each time I called the hotel for this issue (in fact up to 4-5 times), each time I was told that I can make payment at the check-in counter. I have asked for the hotel not to cancel my reservations and was reassured.   Unfortunately, while on my flight to transit at Dubai, my reservation got cancelled. I tried calling the hotel at that time which was around midnight, only to be told that the reservation office only opens in 4 Hrs time. And I had to catch a flight to Karachi. I had no choice but to book a different hotel at this very last minute. Despite several calls and reassurances they still cancelled my booking. I ended up with hundreds of dollars to pay for the international phonically, which was a total waste. …",1,Beach Luxury Hotel

Its staff is very cooperative and the location is also ideal and peaceful. The boy Asif keeps my room neat, clean, and tidy and is a really hardworking boy.  The last time I left my precious steam iron in the hotel room, Mr. Asif kept it safely with lost and found.  I would suggest that hotel management should try to improve their breakfast menu.

Ayesha Akram-Taimoor,"Overall, my stay was going pleasant. Staff was nice, my view was beautiful and seafood was excellent!   Unfortunately, my neighbours thought it to be a good idea to have a loud party on Monday night till 2 am. I called the reception many times but they weren't much help. Ruined a good nights sleep before a hectic day ahead.  Same case with getting some soap, there was soap missing and I had to inquire about it multiple times to finally get it. Sheets were clean but old with some permanent stains so that's about it.   Not bad overall, but really could use some upgrades.",3,Beach Luxury Hotel

SundusRasheed,The staff is courteous and helpful but that doesn't really make up for whats lacking in the room and facilities. The tiled floor gets oddly muggy and has to be cleaned every couple of hours. The breakfast buffet is so uninspiring and held in a dingy old room when it could be in the open with the gorgeous view that only Beach Luxury can offer,3,Beach Luxury Hotel
Iñaki,"I spent more than 2 months living in different rooms of the hotel. It is a nice hotel, far from the crowd of Karachi downtown, quiet place. It should need a bit of renovation, though the building and its furniture currently keeps some of the colonial atmosphere that takes you to the year of its construction (1948, just after the independence). It is a safe place and not expensive, ggod breakfast",4,Beach Luxury Hotel

Ember,"I visited the place in the first week of June. It is a very old hotel near sea port.It seems it was recently renovated as everything was in good condition and seem new and taken good care of. Hotel entrance was beautiful, lobby and restaurants nice and refreshing. Especially the gardens enhances its beauty.   I did online booking that was handled very well by the staff. Though we reached around 11pm. Room was ready and without any delays we were in the my room within 10 min of our arrival.  Clean and tidy room was given with sea view on 2nd floor as I requested online. It was exactly the same.  The staff checked everything before leaving the room. Aircon was working,  Tv, hot water, all was good. Soon afterwards a fruit basket was served,tea and coffee were complimentary. …",4,Beach Luxury Hotel
Sameen S,"Beach luxury Karachi is one of the oldest hotels in town. It is located near sea port and at far end of city. Room rates are economical while service is just average. During stay I could hear someone walking outside room window and there was continous banging outside due to some on going  renovation work which made it very hard to have relaxed time there. Room cleanliness is fine. In bathroom the sink had boiling water even in cold water tap and was unbearable to be used, had to rely on water bottle provided with room service.",3,Beach Luxury Hotel
MubasharBashir,"For the last 70 years, its colonial style verandas towards greek, ancient lush tropical gardens, soothing sea breeze, coquettish 007 restaurant, open spaces as well as various nooks and crannies witnessed Karachi’s splendid past. I stayed there during mid August, slept in an old renovated room, walked through its corridors while recalling bygone whispers of past celebrities and legends, social mischievous gossips, political intrigues and secrets. It was nice experience.  By the way, it is almost adjacent to I.I. Chundrigar Road, where i had the few scheduled meetings.",4,Beach Luxury Hotel

A little away from the bustling city which was nice as we have our own transport. Food on the floating restaurant was awesome. Initially we were upgraded to a suite which was great, only to be downgraded later to a double room. I have traveled a lot around the world, and it was the only time i was downgraded after getting upgraded initially.

Imagine there is a rusted thumb pin standing erect in kids side of swimming pool. My 6 year old son got pierced by it. The whole pin got inserted in his foot while there was no medicine / first aid box or help available at the pool area. The coach at the pool was clueless and had nothing to do except thrashing and shouting on kids. I had to take out the pin and wait for the bleeding to stop. After I reached reception and complained, then they were able to provide only few medicines after searching for 10 to 15 minutes. Imagine that they don't have any over the counter pain killer available even paracetamol? My son has now phobia to step in a swimming pool.…",1,Beach Luxury Hotel

Shahzad,"Located closer to major business attractions, Beach Luxury is a blend of traditions and modernity. Hotel building is impressive and reminds the lost era of British Raj and old Karachi. Near to Sea Front and mangroves, it is perhaps the oldest resort hotel. Rooms are specious with good views and affordable price. Ambience is great and environment is relaxing. Some grey areas, House Keeping is poor. Upon arriving the room, I had to ask for towels and sleepers, which were not placed earlier. Next morning, despite telling duty manager and placing card outside to make up the room, no one bothered to do it witin next 8 hours. Bad indeed for such a big name  ",4,Beach Luxury Hotel
Ziaullah S,"Myself with one of my colleague recently stayed at this hotel. We spent good five days there. Rooms are reasonable and recently renovated.

This is probably one of the worst hotels i've stayed in.  We booked a superior double room but were given a twin, which we then had to wait 4 hours in order to get the double that we booked. Room is ok but bathroom was pretty filthy with very poor sink and shower. No in room tea and coffee facilities. Hotel advertises a swimming pool which i think is for display purposes only as it was disgusting despite a guy looking like he was cleaning it.

Room service food menu is very light on your pocket yet offers very limited options. The 007 Restaurant offers a very good breakfast buffet and a modest lunch menu.  The hotel comes alive soon after sunset with various corporate events or weddings happening in the lawns or banquet hall. the terrace cafe is a good area to pass your time in the afternoons over a good cup of tea, cofee or fresh juice.

Fresh pomegranate juice is a must in the afternoon.There is a pool and a garden which face the lagoon and the grounds are well kept. For value, this place is a deal.

The rooms are filthy, the toilets worse than those of cheap guesthouses, the waiters and housekeeping staff spit paan in the flower beds in front of guests, the walls are stained and so are the towels. For the number of staff members that loiter around, it sure doesn't look like the management knows what to get from them. This hotel is a learning opportunity for all those in the hospitality industry looking to find out what never to do when running a hotel.",2,Beach Luxury Hotel
Lucien L,"I understood that the Beach Luxury hotel was not going to be at the same standard as a international business hotel. The prices of the rooms (reasonable, given the good location and security of the property) told me as much. Arriving, the hotel was about what I had expected, run-down, but decent construction and a reasonably reliable internet connection. The problem is simply the hygiene of the rooms.  In two nights, I had two different rooms and both were infested with bed bugs that bit me and kept me up all night. Even after complaining to the manager, all I got was a ""sorry"" and a shrug. I get the impression they have the same complaint every night. I would avoid this hotel at all costs on my next trip to Karachi.",1,Beach Luxury Hotel

There were no even a one brand new bed sheet 2. Room were not cleaned up. You can see the closet 3. Walls were full of mold 4. In the breakfast while pouring coffee from the pot, cockroach came from inside. I showed the waiter, he looked meaningless, did sth as nothing to do. After i asked for a new coffee he brought.   I paid this service around 200$ per night, as Bed&breakfast. Dont even pass by ",1,Beach Luxury Hotel

Nice location of being few minutes away from the main saddar area and just close enough to reach it within few minutes.  Due to my change in travel plans we arrived a day earlier and were checking out a day earlier hence we told the hotel to modify our booking and charge us accordingly.  Initially the hotel refused and said that something like that can’t be done as we had a third party booking ect ect. After few days of constantly demanding about it they were willing to make the change. The hotel policies are not at all ethical and it does what’s in their best interest which i noticed many times.

The overall feeling for me (the 60s/70s feeling) was good and those were good times indeed ;). The hotel can be improved in many ways but lets leave it for their owners to decide.  The rooms are basic with good individual air conditioning split units. The smell of moisture in the closed room with little or no sunlight might irritate some people. I got used to it after few minutes.  The room service on average take at least half an hour for your order. A couple of times when they are really busy, it took them 2 hours for a cup of tea.  A small gym and swimming pool was included in the package.  The best restaurant was the Casbah in my opinion, for its lovely…",4,Beach Luxury Hotel

Apparently the management has lost interest in keeping pace with the times and latest trends. Walking into this place gives you a nostalgic feeling going back to the '50s and '60's. The swimming pool is old and shabby and not very big. Access route passes in front of the US Counsulate which sometimes can create a nuisance and traffic jam if there is a security threat. Traffic jams are frequent during rush hours.  Pros: One of the most peaceful and secure locations for a hotel in Karachi, this property is built on the edge of a mangrove area adjacent to the port.

There is nothing much to do if travelling alone like myself. Sure I went window-shopping as a Chinese but it may be a no-no for a westerner. The  only problem which did not bother me is there is not much  programmes on TV. Also brown outs but only lasting a short while.

Whilst the check-in was a bit slow (5:30 am in the morning) - understandable as it was prayer time, the rest of the stay was absolutely marvelous.     The room was amazing with wide views of the creek. Every effort to make it comfortable, with A/C. fan and lighting.  The bathroom was spacious (except I would recommend a non-slip mat be made available) but apart from that, there was nothing wrong with the room.  Brilliant room service.

My personal favorite among the restaurants is the Wild Rice:  if you are into advice from the Cleveland Clinic concerning what you eat, you'll like the sushi options (and preparation) available.  If you plan to return, it's a good idea to join the reasonably priced Serena frequent stay club which gets you 15%-20% discount on food, services, including spa services:  it pays for itself in one visit (mine was a little over two weeks).  Sundays, the brunch is quite nice but the local diplomats and well-to-do make this a time for reservations, so even as a guest, you should plan book in advance.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

At breakfast, don't forget to try natural honey which is from cottage industry.  Room service is great, the place is good for meeting and inviting friends for lunches/dinner.

However, aircon blows very cold and is not easy to manipulate. Lighting in room is complex and runs off a complex touch-panel system which is designed for design's sake.

I got the opportunity to try out their complementary breakfast and found it to be excellent. Zamana restaurant is the only place in the hotel that serves 24/7 while the rest of the cafes and restaurants close their doors well before 11 which sometimes seems a bit too early for a non-islamabad resident who are more accustomed to eating out late at night.

Check in took some extra time(due to delayed house keeping) but Mr Manmohan on reception was so co-operative and friendly that it did not really bother us. However, the rooms had shabby furniture(sofas, chairs). Carpets were worn out, discolored and awfully dirty. Duvet covers were dirty and faded. On complaining, Mr Ghazanfar from house keeping took charge of things and made sure all our issues are sorted. Obviously carpet and furniture remained there and was a source of displeasure- Breakfast in Zamana restaurant was  AMAZING. too good. Staff was active, professional. Check out was quite smooth. I would like to appreciate two people in particular - Mr. Manmohan…",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel
JT L,"Stayed 3 nights and it was brilliant. Excellent rooms, service, food, ambiance and overall quality of everything. I will always stay at this hotel whenever I travel to Islamabad.   Everything was classy and oozed quality. We were able to rent their car/driver effortlessly as well when we needed it.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
dctravla,I stayed at the Serena Islamabad for 10 days in April on a business trip. The complimentary breakfast at Zamana was delicious and had a wide range of options. Staff were quite accommodating and pleasant. We also used one of the conference rooms (including catering for snacks and lunch) and it was an excellent experience. I had a chance to use the roof top pool on my last day and it was heavenly. I hope to return sometime soon!,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
AsadKhan,"Its probably the best in the capital city. Large parking area, transportation available from parking area till the main entrance (You can walk upto as well). Building is state of the art. It is located at foothills of the beautiful Margala Hill closer to diplomatic enclave. Beautiful architecture, refreshing lawns/gardens, wide corridors, huge halls and above all very professional and cooperative staff. It really gives you the feeling of openness and freshness.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Sammy Jo D,"I was Unfortunate enough to stay at this hotel for 8 days on a prebooked holiday. In my experience of travelling around the world I have never before encountered such Abismal  service and staff attitude. On arrival I was informed that the agreed and booked rate had increased for no apparent reason. I was therefore placed in a lower quality room that which I had booked. This together with the unexpected, unadvertised building works ongoing every day did not bode well. I was less than happy, the reception staff were impolite, uncaring and downright rude to me. I was belittled in front of other guests, as a female travelling alone with my 5 year old daughter. I was made to feel that there was nothing I could do about the situation other than take what I was given.Dare I say that as…",1,Islamabad Serena Hotel
TravellingAround,We had a fantastic time as family. Restaurants and coffee shop is one of the best in the world. The staff tries to please you and go an em extra mile for that. Food and ambiance are both second to none. In particular the fish was excellent and cake from Raka Poshi cafe was superb. Will go there again and again. ,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Renat M,"Just very good one. Nice place, good rooms. Surprisingly spacious restaurant with good selection of food. Line management during breakfast is a challenge, but kind of expected. One huge plus - is gym and pool. Never expected both of them to be that spacious and well equipped. Definitely a great stay for Islamabad.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Moinuddin Hyder,"I had a pleasant stay over in Serena recently for 2 nights. World class ambience, mouth-watering foods (breakfast, lunch, dinner), well behaved stuffs and lastly the best of the best security arrangements made my visit memorable. I would highly recommend the place.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Amer Baloch,"I am frequent local and int'l traveler. I am also member of Starwood SPG and have stayed in very good hotels worldwide. But Serena Islamabad is surely different. Location is ideal, surroundings are lush green mountains and very beautiful well maintained gardens and large spacious building. Theme based dinners in gardens are not to be missed. Staff is most friendly. And not to forget, Serena limousine service knows how to resolve any problem of traveler stretching beyond limits to achieve results. Bottom line - memorable stay.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Zaina E,"A very luxurious hotel but their rooms definitely need an up lift but they are clean  . Food isn't that tasty and there is a lot of hassle going in and out of the hotel due to security reasons ! You have to park your car or get dropped at their main gate and then go up the stairs and walk few steps until you get to the hotel entrance ! However , due to the limited choices in islamabad ,it is my number 1",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Ariabod,"I have stayed so far 3 time at Serena (while I tried two other good rated hotels in town when there was no availability at Serena) and I can easily say that Serena beats others by far. The hotel is a nice property with various facilities. Security is sometime too much and annoying, but you should consider local risks and requirements. Services are in general good, airport transfer is available free of charge and breakfast at Zamana is of high quality.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
SalGhaz,"Excellent hotel, clean / new. Room service was good, staff friendly, food was good too. The breakfast is excellent with a lot of variety. I wasn't satisfied with the room which they were offering me, and they happily switched me to another room. Stayed for 2 nights. Would definitely come back",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Nadia Z,as a lone 18 year old I was made to feel safe and secure. security was present.  staff were absolutely lovely most went that extra mile to help till ny friends and family flew out to join me. we stayed for 3 weeks before moving on to another place in Pakistan. am visiting pakistan again this summer and have a 2 weeks stay booked again,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
SERHAT B,I spent two nights. Breakfast and dinner (private) was very good. Gym was not impressive buy OK except nice pool view. Staff was very helpful. They brought my lost luggage from airport. Congress center was good but need a better audio system. The most amazing facility was free laundry up to four items per day and free drinks nuts etc in the room (executive room only?). Security was nearly paranoid as expected. I would like like to stay again.,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
decomouse,"I've stayed in Islamabad many times on business trips, and can't recommend the Serena enough. The staff will go out of their way to help you out and accommodate your requests. They're very used to dealing with foreigners and westerners and are generally quit friendly. The food is quite good as well, although I recommend the local fare out and about, if you're looking to eat in or eat conveniently, you won't be disappointed.   Finally, a word on security... the Serena is the safest hotel in Islamabad, and most big wigs stay there when they're in town. It's also very close to the government areas which are heavily patrolled by the security forces.   In short, the Serena is a great place to relax and rest in the heart of Islamabad.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
YumYum2GG,"I had originally booked for two weeks but that was extended to 7 fabulous weeks.  In this time I got to,know the hotel and its first class staff very well.  As a solo female guest I was impressed with the extra care they took of me.  The security is tight but necessary and at no time did I feel that it was oppressive. The various restaurants inside the Serena  meant you always had fabulous variety.  The breakfast in the main restaurant offered a fantastic selection covering Asian, English, Chinese and American dishes.  I tried them all at sometime and all were great.  The staff throughout the hotel were first class and very attentive.  The gyms were well kitted out and the trainers very user friendly.  The pools were elegant and glamorous could have been on the Italian Riviera. …",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Anja V,My flight got delayed by a day due to fog so I ended up spending a day at Serena. The hotel is amazing. I stayed with them 2008 and prior a few times and they have improved a lot since then. The only thing that I found to be odd was the heightened security but that is necessity. The rooms and the hotel was extremely clean and well kept. The only thing that can use some improvement is the front desk staff and their training so they can manage guests properly. I was standing in the line and people were cutting them. The front desk staff didn't care and they were just helping anyone who was at the very front. They should be sending people who are cutting lines at the very back.,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Nick S,"given that i have only stayed in one hotel in ISB - the Serena, its not possible to judge its quality against other hotels in the area. So, perhaps its better to judge it against its sister hotels in Dushanbe and Kabul.   Firstly, the location - its just on the edge of the diplomatic enclave, but still feels secure. Like any hotel, if someone wants to get in they will, but Serena Islamabad does not cut corners with security. For me its a perfect location adjacent to my office in the business complex. However, Dushanbe Serena wins the location battle due to the fact that its easy to walk from there to restaurants, MOT, opera, etc.   Rooms - the rooms in ISB are lovely, very cosy and comfortable.  Bed is super comfy, showers hot and strong, nice sofa to work in or watch TV. Most…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Duncan_R_Ellis,Stayed here on a number of occasions during business trips to Islamabad.  Strict attention to security that was always through yet professionally performed.

A great stay for the western business traveller.,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Binno2015,Overall was a v good stay but the food at zamana restaurant was pathetic also the reservation people totally misguided us about the rooms we had to pay an extra room because of that whereas 2 rooms were enough for us and we were provided with extra beds but they misguided us on the phone and told that u have to book 3 rooms coz the room doesn’t fit 3 people as were were with children!!!,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Muhammad Qaisar,"Serena is one of the best facilities not only in Pakistan but globally. They have best facilities, spacious rooms, quality amenities, friendly and welcoming staff.

Akram K,"We went to the restaurant for breakfast . At the entrance we were stopped on a silly reason that my guest was wearing shorts , whereas some white foreigners were freely roaming around wearing shorts , picking their foods .

azimthedream,"Stayed here at a great rate twice in June 2016.  The rooms are standard Serena style which is different than many traditional chains, but may not be to everyone's tastes. Dark hand carved and crafted woods are accented by local tapesties and soft furnishings.  The service was wonderful and check in and check out were prompt and efficient both times.  For me, this is really the only place to stay in Islamabad.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Ali H,"This is a copy of the complaint I sent to the Serena management. Worst experience ever. This is not a 5 star hotel. Pathetic service, awful accommodations.  Hello.  I stayed at the Serena in Islamabad on the night of the 30th of December.  My experience there was one of the worst I've had at any hotel, let alone one that claims to be a five star hotel.  I paid 45903.40 PKR, approx 450 USD to get a junior suite which was unbearably hot. I called guest services and asked why after having pressing the cooling button, turning the fan on high, and having the temperature at 18C and waiting for about 2 hours, the room was still hot. I was connected to 'engineering' who told me that if I was feeling hot I should ""open the windows"".  I called guest services and asked to speak to the…",1,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Sajjad R,This hotel sets the standard of what a 5 star hotel should be.  Everything was perfect.    They also have a complimentary pick up and drop off at the bus terminal while other hotels like Marriott only have it for the airport that charge you for pick up and drop off from any other place.    If there anything I would recommend is to have some hot items like samosas and shami kababs at the business lounge Nazara.  The lobby to rooms feels a little stuffy; perhaps more ventilation?,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
syedamerg,Good choice of food. Nice ambiance and service. But very expensive at almost Rs.3000 per head. And this does not include any drinks; not even water. The least they can do is include drinks. It would be super if they rationalize the per head cost as well :),4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Arsalan K,"I have been a regular visitor to Islamabad Serena hotel, never have I experienced such unprofessional behaviour. I ordered an apple pie two days before my check out date. Totally unexpected , the day I was checking out I went to pick up my order only to be disappointed that the order wasn't communicated to the kitchen  You don't expect such slackness from a member of the ""hotels of the world"" what ever that stands for ?  It was my sons birthday and I promised to bring him his favourite apple pie from Serena Islamabad , but due to the poor coordination between Rakaposhi and the bakery it couldn't happen :(   Totally disappointed with Serena Islamabad this time   ",1,Islamabad Serena Hotel

We asked for a taxi to take us around the city, but when the time comes, it was raining heavily. The staff canceled the ride with no hassle (grateful for that..) For non-staying guests, it will be a bit hassle for them to enter this hotel and they have to park quite far from the entrance. Parking for staying guests are also very limited. A wide variety of food is served for their buffet breakfast.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The overall experience was great. The interior is absolutely lovely. The staff was helpful, especially the manager. I can't recall her name, I think it was mahnam, but she was very helpful and very professional. Good to see girls in this profession, made me proud to see a girl running the place with such charisma.   The food on the other hand was average. There was a hair in my fish. The soup was good. Given we paid an exorbitant amount for our meal, the hygiene should not have been compromised. ",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel

When I arrived the guard stopped our car below the reception Ramp(The ramp was close they said due to security), but I saw several cars going up the ramp. I had to come out of my car in blazing heat, with my luggage as they did NOT allow the car to park there, when I asked about check in the guards started looking the other way or were talking among themselves, very shocking & rude behavior, they allowed several cars to go up the ramp to main reception & drop off area.

Its over priced in comparison to what they offer. Same to zamana restaurant it was a crap over cooked buffet thats over priced, far better eating in a restaurant in bahria town.  The staff all though try to welcome you they spend far too much time talking to you when your trying to eat in peace with family. Serena is just about amazing decoration and style of building beside that its crap. After my spa went to the rakaposhi cafe omg the pizza was disgusting and took 45 minutes.

juergen33,"This was my second time at the Serena which still came across as a truly stunning hotel and perhaps the best choice when looking for a five-star place in Islamabad. Yet, the staff seemed to be a bit overwhelmed by the crowds this time and never forgot to mention that the hotel was fully booked.   When visiting the breakfast buffet just before closing time, loads of dirty dishes littered empty tables (resembling any of those all inclusive places) with staff looking frustrated and surely in need of a recovery from the ""public onslaught"". Perhaps less convincing was that we experienced the same ""overflow"" situation  at the check-in desk, well, at 4 a.m., i.e. in the middle of the night! I guess, there is some work to do for the management, and that is surely not to put more…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Lingling22,We stayed at this hotel as my partner had a conference to attend. The security was of high standard.  The entrance and lobby of the hotel was very outlandish with a lot of marble and chandeliers.  The rooms were large as too was the bathroom. We found that the bed was very hard therefore had trouble sleeping. There was plenty of hot water. I had a tour of the day spa/gym which was lovely but a bit pricey.  The room service was very good as too the buffet breakfast which had a good range of food and also had a large variety of newspapers which pleased my husband.  The free airport transfers was a blessing. ,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

AidaAinsworth,"The Serena Hotel is considered the best hotel in Islamabad so the staff and administration have just stopped trying.  Rooms are well designed and thoughtfully decorated in the traditional style of the region. But attention is not being paid to uphold the original standard of the hotel. Lights are often fused, electric outlets don't work and at times even the air conditioning plays up. Food, once a source of pride for the hotel, is now literally inedible. There is a dearth of hotels in the city so people are forced to visit or stay here. That is no reason however to allow laxity and decline in the standard and quality of this marvellously grand and strategically located hotel",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel

All my work was actually conducted at the hotel so I did not venture out at all. The room was good. Breakfast is reasonable. One night dinner was room service. That took over an hour to come, which was excessive. The food was however worth the wait. I have stayed at the Serena before. It has maintained its standard. ",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Instead, we had to pay for the doctor and meds. We had to postpone a flight. Spent all days in room with lousy room service who was very slow and forgettable. Not a single apology all days and we had to pay the full price!!   Room was too small for all the old, crappy furniture. Everywhere else in the world such hotel would have only 3 stars.

Taymur M,Serena architecture is exquisite and spacial energy quite positive. All this is marginalised by 3 hour wait for check in while the reservation and accounts department sort their confusion on whether or not the payment for the room has been made or not. Parent company in Singapore booked a room for my 3 night stay. Although the reservations were made online the parent company was made to wire transfer the money as the corporate credit card did not have the companies name but the person employed in the company.

kr0elle,"Serena is ""the most beautiful thing to see in Islamabad"" as one colleague of mine pointed out. It's definitely a good place to stay at. However, compared to other hotels of this kind, it lacks perfection in certain details. The state of repair of my room was definitely sub standard (loose electricity outlets on the desk, safe didn't fit an A4 folder...). Hotel service is good and they provide a good range of amenities. In the restaurants, however, service is very slow and inattentive.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

It's ornate corridors and gleaming decor forces you to talk in hushed tones. Almost cold.... but the genuine welcome and smiles of the security guards puts you at ease. The brunch was elaborate and layout great but items, some of them , were so spread out that it was easy to miss them altogether. The choice of entrees was great among other things. The waiters though polite needed to be reminded again and again to change the plates please! All in all a good experience.

In general I feel very safe in Pakistan but the property insures the safety of all it's guest. The power went out a couple of times and the internet isn't a spotty as it used to be.

Stefan_and_Lorna,"There is no question that the Serena ranks highly as a 5 star hotel in terms of convenience, landscape, size of rooms and facilities. It is indeed a beautiful hotel. But, what lets the Serena down is the service in their restaurants, quality of room service food and general understanding of customer service.  The IT in their business centre is from the dark ages - antiquated PCs, poorly maintained equipment and PCs with software problems from lack of basic PC hygiene. If you're using this hotel on vacation, I'm sure it will be a pleasant experience.  However, if you're on business, a seasoned traveller, you're likely to be frustrated.

It is a large hotel set in its own grounds and security, as with all international hotels in Pakistan, is “entry” intense – reassuringly so. Once inside, however, it’s charming. It is decorated and furnished in classical Pakistani cultural style which I like, although international travellers may prefer something a little more contemporary.  I stayed for two nights, with a gap night in between and my Executive rooms were on the 4th floor and 5th floor, both a long walk from the elevator shaft but they were both large, clean and well amenitised.

abbasshah,"Stayed here on my way back to UK. Lovey 5 star hotel with everything you need. The room was very nice and comfortable, the bathroom was plush.  Only complaint i had was that i asked for a complimentary drop off to the airport in the morning and when the vehicle arrived it was just a mid-range car.  I was with my family and our luggage would not have fitted in.  The hotel tried to charge me for another car until i complained that they knew i was travelling with my family and thus should have booked me a van.  The duty manager did resolve it immediately by getting another car to hold the luggage - so very good customer service.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Sheharyar A,"Given the limited choices of 5 star hotels in Islamabad,  this is probably the best. The hotel has great facilities. The only drawback is the added security check that comes with it. A special thank you to Mr. Karim who was the duty manager when we checked in who was very kind and helpful. ",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Tariq M,Stayed at the Serena Hotel over Christmas with The Family whilst on Holiday.very luxurious hotel .very spacious rooms and very clean and well maintained hotel.free mini bar drinks topped up daily.now you do not get that in every hotel.  great buffet breakfast with wide variety of continental and Asian foods.too many dishes to choose from.same with lunch and evening meals.if you stay at this hotel you must try the outdoor buffet in the Serena gardens no matter what the weather.the staff go out of their way to make you comfortable and enjoy you meal with live pakistani singers singing classical pakistani songs.one of the best hotels in have stayed at and would definitely recommend and use again.,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Hania A,"Always a great stay at Serena! The staff is super attentive and the experience is always good.  They have an extensive range of restaurants inside and they are all good! I tried wilds rice recently and absolutely loved it!  The security is good at Serena, so you do have some peace of mind.  It is on the pricier side but you get what you pay for! Would recommend!

Arbab G,I went to this place yesterday for Lunch. It's a stunning place to visit. Very welcoming and comforting. Security is very tight but they were very helpful. The food was average apart from desserts. Minced meat was very rubbery indeed. You couldn't chew it.  I expect it to be checked  by chefs before It iis served to customers.,3,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Salim MOHAMEDNOUR,"I was for a conference in Islamabad when I was offered that Hotel. It's a spotless clean rooms with all required facilities in.   Room are seriously big and the view is nice from the balcony.   Most enjoyable thing is the food. All meals were fantastic and the buffet was more than excellent.   Nothing much to see in the city, so stay in your room or enjoy all the amazing restaurants with different flavours from different parts of the world.   I highly recommend it.

Tor K,"As well as Serena Hotel in Kabul could be considered the safest, best and also the nicest hotel in Kabul I would rate the Serena Islamabad at the same renege. Clean, safe, fine service, good quality rooms, and by all means several really nice restaurants. Everything about this hotel is at the best. The only thing I missed was to be able to order a beer to my food, not even alcohol free beer is available which I believe is sad",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

rjmachin,"Pakistan doesn't have the greatest reputation as a tourist destination, I guess, but amidst whatever lawlessness might or might nor be happening outside the heavily barricaded gates, the Serena is an oasis of peace and calm. Rooms and corridors are a bit tired, but good beds, fresh cotton sheets and Penhaligons' fine toiletries in the bathroom make up for that. Services friendly and helpful, good selection of restaurants and a great pool. Excellent Wifi too - and if you're worried about security, glance up and check out the armed guards patrolling the roof of both blocks... though its questionable whether that, the three sets of barricades on the way in and the X-Ray machines at the entrances make you feel more or less relaxed. The hotel is 'dry' but non-Muslims can have drinks…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
a_night_here,"If it wasn't in Pakistan, this would be a 6 star hotel - great for a good night's sleep and atmosphere conducive for high-end business. Wifi all throughout and lots of backup generators to counter the city's load shedding. Great breakfast buffet - but take a pass on the other restaurants... rent a car (cheap, but not as cheap as a taxi) somewhere different. Beautiful place to see and explore.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Tom O,"OK, so to get the negative out of the way, first.  Islamabad has lots of security measures in place and the Serena is no exception.  At times it can seem like a pain but consider the alternatives!  Maybe that isn't a negative after all.  The hotel is grand - the public areas are a little over the top but manage to stay the right side of garish.  The rooms are roomy and comfortable and have plenty of clothes space, a good desk area and excellent broadband and WiFi capabilities.  TV has enough channels to keep you occupied.  A nice touch is the free mini-bar - just water and juice but says a lot about the quality of the Management and their approach to business.  Also, a kind of 'floor butler' is attentive and kept us supplied with fresh fruit.  One negative was the pillows.  They…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The facilities are superb, the location excellent, the food varied and uniformly good, and the staff always extremely helpful.  But even the best have room for improvement.   Wireless internet access in some of the rooms could be improved.  And finally a tip for the foreign traveller.  It is very easy to get locked in the golden handcuffs of the Serena.  Make sure you go out and make sure you also give other, less posh, hotels a try too.  Many of them are also very good, albeit very different.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Umair,I have stayed in Serena a few times on a business stay and this hotel has never ever disappointed me. The rooms can be booked at 150-200$ a night and are inclusive of breakfast. The architecture of the hotel is grand and supreme with massive tall hallways and very intricate masonry wherever you go. There is a very comprehensive security layout which is a little inconvenient at times but I am okay with it as it is for my own good. The breakfast buffet is lovely with a large variety of food ranging from local items to smoked turkey to sausages to cereals to anything else you could think of having. The location of the hotel is also good as it is a stone throw away from the diplomatic enclave and a few minutes away from the shopping areas in Islamabad.  The rooms are large yet cozy…,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
ESVincent,"On a hot steamy afternoon in Islamabad I stumbled across the Serena Hotel. I have stayed in these hotels in Africa and the Middle East but this was sheer delight.  Stunning architecture that echoes the Mughal empire, beautiful gardens and inside soaring arches reminscent of Moorish Spain and Cordoba. There was so much to like from the outstanding coffee shop ( excellent cakes, pasties and coffee but do try the mint lemonade) to the wildly wonderful ""Wild Rice"" fusion asian restaurant. I had the best Nasi Goreng here since Indonesia, there is also Al Mahgreb a great Morroccan Restaurant.  This is an excellent oasis of calm, service and value for money - if in Islamabad go there, if in Pakistan go there and be there.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Of course this is Pakistan and there are things that the hotel cannot control (e.g. power blackouts that mean no lights for a few seconds until the generator kicks back in), but the staff are really nice, the rooms are large and clean, the food is pretty good, and the lobby is a chance to revisit the grand colonial days.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Colcor5,"I spent 4 days in this hotel for a conference.  Security was tight, and it took some time to enter the hotel.  The rooms are fine, with excellent air-conditioning and pretty much everything you need.  Drinks in the in-room mini fridge are complimentary, which is a nice touch. There are several restaurants and a coffee shop, and the food was good. The Breakfast buffet is included, and there is a huge selection. The pool and spa area is beautiful!  The only issue I had was the short cord on the blow dryer, which is located at the desk in the room.  Other than that, it was a great stay.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
spicycaesar,"To be fair, hotel choices in Pakistan are all about security for most business travelers. On that basis the Serena ranks highly as it is an armed fortress. That aside, notwithstanding a grand lobby which implies quality rooms and service, the hotel is average at best. This would be acceptable if rates reflected that fact. They don't and it is silly money for what you get. Given the lack of competition, I suspect that the Aga Khan will continue to laugh all the way to the bank!",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Rana U,"This is for sure the best hotel in Islamabad. The rates are good as well especially if you compare them with the rates of marriot hotel. Their breakfast was amazing!  The only downside is that it has become a fortress. The secure measures are intense and can get annoying. However, one must realize that it is for their own safety!",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
JonB_SA,"A veritable fortress to enter, but given the security situation I suppose that's appropriate.  Spacious public areas, high ceilinged and quite grand, good restaurants.   Rooms generous and modern fittings, although not quite to top international standards.  Some traditional architectural styling touches to take the edge off a modern building.   Good pool.   Service sometimes a bit brusque but very efficient.    Location ideal for Government, Embassies.  Reliable airport transfers.  Good wifi throughout the hotel.   The Marriott, which I visited but did not stay at, is less grand, but seemed busier.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

It is a bit of a hassle to get in due to all safety regulations in town, but when you're in you have all you have wished for: fitness, pool, several good restaurants, shops of all kind, bars (no alcohol, although I heard you can order alcohol in your room). I had a very pleasant stay.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

I was travelling on business as a single female and I felt very secure in the Hotel. The room and the bathroom was very clean and it had all the amenities that you would expect from a five star hotel. If you want fantastic views of the Margalla hills, request for a room that has views. They come with a private balcony and you will not regret it. Also try to get a room on or above the fourth floor as you will be able to access the VIP restaurant situated on the roof top. The views are breathtaking from there.  I had a problem with my window (it was not locking) and I rang the housekeeping people at 12 midnight and they came and fixed it…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
ATIDC,"Overall, this is the way a hotel should be run. Staff was excellent and very attentive. This is particularly impressive given that this hotel is massive and is typically at about 90 percent occupancy.   A few details: first, it bears mention that the hotel is very secure. Second, the hotel itself is beautiful. The grounds are lush and the common areas are grand. The gym, spa, and pool facilities are excellent. There are two gyms--one for women only and one that is mixed. The pool in the spa area is about a standard 25 yard pool and is fine for lounging about or swimming laps. The locker rooms are newly done are well kept.   The food is excellent. I ate in the main (buffet) area and also in a number of different restaurants. All the food was top quality.

Undoubtedly the safest, most secure and most prestigious hotel in Islamabad. 3. Good pool(s), spa, sauna, steam room and gym.  Con's:  1. Service can be extremely mixed ranging from good to outright indifferent. Examples are a) having to wait for someone to serve you coffee at breakfast time. This is not due to a lack of staff but a lack of observance of the staff to customer needs. When a customer comes and sits at a table and they should be quickly greeted with the offer of either tea or coffee. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT ALL…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

While my husband was bz at the hotel with his conference I was shopping at the local market places taken and guided by the hotel driver.   Th food at th buffet restaurant was amazing! The Haleem was exceptional.  The cafe that had a sitting arrangement outside in the garden ( forgot the name). Had the best view.

You begin with car checking then bag checking then you drive up to the hotel and you’re met with reception staff that can’t answer questions about the hotels facilities and cuisines. Walks to and from the lobby, elevator and rooms are annoyingly long.   On the brighter side it is a lovely architectural experience, decent food quality and lovely gardens, and rooms, bathrooms and executive lounges are all very 5 star.

I have stayed extensively at the Marriott in Khi, the PC in Lahore and these guys are the slowest to respond to simple requests like sending laundry service or ordering room service. However what made their service COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE is that I one day after checking in to a non-smoking room (which I had specifically requested since I and my sister are allergic to smoke), we got back from attending my cousin's wedding function in the hotel at nite to find that our bathroom was reeking of cigarette smoke!

They also have two heated swimming pools, which made dipping in the pool so refreshing, especially in Islambad's autumn weather.

The welcoming staff was well versed in English & sped up our check in process (which is rare in Pakistan). I found the room to be very very clean & odorless (even though it was a smoking room). The room had all kinds of amenities that any 5 Start Hotel in the west would have for example a very comfortable bed & 4 choices of pillows (including goose down), mini bar, TV with International Channels, Wifi & much more. The Room service was excellent as they delivered within 30 minutes & the food was very tasty. The Gym is amazing with lots of equipment and space & so are the 2…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Rob W,I was very pleased with a week's stay in this very comfortable hotel.  The service is excellent with nice rooms and a very good restaurant.

raha e,"I am a business man and I spent 210 night per year in hotels so I would like to think that when I rate a hotel or go through the bother of writing something in the trip advisor then it must be really bad.......  Islamabad Serena Hotel is one of the worst  hotels i have never had to say in.......the furniture are very bad and most of the chairs in the rooms are broken…. completely unusable not to mentioned the extremely filthy smelly carpet . Also, the room had a very bad and strong smell of sewerage ……. I called the reception over 12 times wanting to talk to the front disc manager or general manager and for 12 times I was told they are too busy with internal meeting and once they have time they will call me back of course that never took place despite all 12 calls.

BarnesTown," Stayed here several times and it has several pluses but increasingly feels like it has a few too many minuses too.  On the positive side, the rooms are decidedly comfortable and well appointed. The beds are well maintained. The staff is attentive at most times. Even though it is a large hotel, feels quiet and not ""fish markety"" like many other hotels of this size. The restaurants are perfectly serviceable with a more than decent breakfast.  The negatives. The ""identikit"" rooms are starting to look quite dated now. The staff will invariably take too much time, dare I say muck up, on a couple of transactions per visit, whether it is the check in or a simple food order. The heavy security is used to enforce odd policies such as a no external food policy - something I have not come…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
famezde,The hotel is really nice and the rooms very comfortable. Some room rates include daily dry cleaning which is great if you are in travel business.   The concierge ladies are really helpful in showing how to put the hijab in different styles.   Food at the restaurant is good but very spicy. The gym facilities are also good although a bit small. There is a separate gym for ladies if you feel uncomfortable exercising along men.,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Coco B,"OK so I know that this place is all about the snootyness factor- I can enjoy that at times. But I found little to enjoy about this place! There were tacky christmas decorations everywhere, and some especially blase non-descript western instrumental music playing in the lobby area. My friend who was white was getting all this ""Good Morning Sir!"", ""Good Evening Sir"", & ""Good middle of the night Sir!"" treatment everytime a member of staff saw him, which was fairly amusing at first but we soon tired of it.  The rooms were also kind of average for a five star hotel, with lack of attention to detail- such as broken handles on the drawers and no light switches right next to the door. The artwork in the halls and rooms felt mandatory and forced, no longer enjoyable because they become…",1,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The rooms are spacious with great view of Margallahs and have good furnishings. There are many things inside mini refrigerator, which come free of charge. The buffet breakfast at Zamana was excellent and catered for all tastes. The rooms are quiet and provide soundproof environment. The staff is courteous and helpful. The only problem which I faced was the service of bell boys. They took over 30 minutes to bring down the luggage of one of our colleagues.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Trav_Blogger,Hotel is truly excellent. Extremely helpful staff. Clean. Good food - both alacarte and buffet. Breakfast is fantastic. Very nice gym and pool area at the hotel.

xon9909,"Serena surely provides a proper 5 star experience. The lobby is wonderful along with  the staff and other senior members. Rooms are very well furnished and give a splendid view of the gardens and the Margalla hills. The food quality is very nice, especially at the Wild Rice. The only problem is that due to the security measures taken by the hotel, you are to get dropped in the parking area and then have to take ur baggage all along while climbing the stairs upto the main entrance, they should look into this thing as I'm sure it doesn't help people lots of luggage.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Staff at Serena is well trained curry rousing. A special thank you to Jamhoor Shah, who served us, for making our family dinner memorable.

However, I like Serena hotels because you feel like you are in the country: the furniture, design, food ,  music- all authentic  to the country.  It is a beautiful  hotel with creatively  furnished rooms. In general, rooms are big, clean and you can find anything that you need in here. I would remove the floor carpeting  though - they are quite  old and in this climate  make almost no reason to keep. The service is impeccable! Very well trained staff everywhere: reception, restaurants. ..and finally,  if you have complaints - they are dealt with in  most  professionall way. Thanks to Mr. Muhammad Altaf Hussain , who keeps high standards of hospitality business  and management.   ",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The conference rooms and the entire team are great and very professional. My luggage was lost during my flight to Pakistan and the Guest Relations Manager was very helpful and supportive in sorting things out for me. Of course, the downside of such luxury facilities in Pakistan is that a high level of security measures and alertness is required. The hotel manages that in a safe and trustworthy way, but it also makes the entire ambiance a bit isolated and locked out from normal life. Of course, this is the reality in Pakistan and not to blame the hotel...overall I would stay at this…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

And silver cutlery!!! Outside the breakfast restaurant there were two Pakistani musicians playing traditional instruments every morning starting around 8.30. The rooms had all you can expect and roomservice offered beer and liqour. I didn't had the time to excersize at the gym but I had a look at it at least.

The compensate breakfast buffet itself worth the price of admission,  they have already 50 option in the buffet. In fact, the food altogether is pretty good at the hotel and not the bland fare one usually finds at five star franchise hotels. The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed in a mughal style,  it's heavily bunkered like a war zone even though things aren't that bad but I suppose all the exaggerated security measures add to the peace of mind for the many foreigners who stay here. It's a damn sought better than the Marriott and at a marginal difference in price if you can find a room here you should absolutely book it.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The rooms are very comfortable. It is especially worth paying the little extra to get an Executive Club room and one with a balcony. My room had a balcony and a great view of the rolling green hills that are Islamabad's backdrop. The club lounge is large and on the top floor. It has great views and an outside terrace area. The Spa and pool are also high class with the pool on the third floor having a great view and an open feel.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The hotel is up on a hill and though so close to everything in Islamabad, it feels serene and removed. My husband and I were there for business, and we stayed in one of the Executive rooms  on the 4th floor.  Even though it wasn't a suite, it was HUGE.  Gorgeous carved furniture, enormous bathroom with 2 sinks, a tub AND a separate shower.  There was a king size bed, a desk, chair with ottoman, AND a loveseat.  Lots of drawers, so many we couldn't use all of them.  It was truly a great home away from home.

Staff are immaculately presented, always friendly and courteous, whatever their role may be.

Pkwanderer,"Stayed in this Hotel for a business trip. The amazing part was there were no welcome drinks..............for a 5 star Hotel, thats absolutely appalling. The Headstead of the bed was tilted at an angle, showing the staff did not give proper attention to their work. The Hotel is very beautiful and the staff at breakfast was very attentive. The Airconditioning got reset everytime there was a power-failure resulting in a very cold room as I always set the thermostat at 27 but everytime it would show me 21 after a power-failure and there were power failures every hour in that time. The check-in is not good as people have to take 30 stairs to reach the check-in level, after a security search that would put any airport to shame!",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Freddy Tan,"In Pakistan, there is a need to take the extra security precautions and Serena hotel has the layer of security that offers the business traveler some peace of mind. Hotel service staff is good and the rooms are clean and well equipped. If you have lounge access, this is an added advantage as space is conducive for work with refreshments.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Israr Ahmad,Serena has the best location in beautiful city of Islamabad. It’s huge hotel and has scenic roads and greenery around.  The hotel staff are well mannered and efficient. The check in is quick and welcoming. The rooms are capacious. The bed and pillows are clean and soft. All accessories are available in room and wash room.  I don’t know why most hotels keep shaving gel instead of shaving foam in bathroom? The breakfast at Zamana was perfect. The lobby is awesome for relaxation. WiFi was free and with good speed.   In short my two day stay was perfect. I forgot to collect my charger and left in the room but the manager called me a day later and even offered me to deliver it to me in Peshawar. That was impressive gesture and shows the honesty of even the lower staff. 👍  ,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
K1ANY786,"Stayed here, again, August 2019. When I booked the room via booking.com I booked an executive king room which stated it should have s balcony/terrace with views of hills or lake. However, the room I got had no terrace/balcony with views of a side road and generators. After complaining I was moved to a room with a balcony.  It's worth complaining and not just accepting what they decide to give you.  Try and get a room in 5th floor with even numbers which will give you beautiful views over the manicured gardens",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Abdullah A,"This hotel is bad i would not recommend staying there the rooms are old ,we had an incident with the duty manager Jubran where we and our visiting guests were threatened to be thrown out of the hotel with the guest samples in a very rude manners it is like a military camp,the only good area is the breakfast zone",1,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Osman Gul,"Over the Eid holiday weekend (which turned out to be a long weekend), the hotel decided to close down 3 of its most-liked restaurants - the Lebanese, the pool-side Pakistani/BBQ, and another restaurant.

ESVincent,"The Serena is the hotel in Isloo. It has stunning gardens, excellent restaurants and a well appointed Spa. It's the centre for anyone and everyone. Having eaten there many times it was interesting to go and stay.... staff are as you would expert courteous and welcoming but the rooms were surprising. As a member of the Leading Hotels of the World I was surprised to find in my room  a) stained carpets - black stains near the window b) furniture that had deep scores on it - the desk and the table) c) a bath where when you put the water tap - the water sprayed everywhere  This was an older room but disappointing. The bed was magnificent and I had excellent sleep. There is always much to like about the Serena and remains the place to stay in Islamabad but it needs refreshing",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Kciff,"They advertise non-smoking rooms but our first room was stinky as if they tried to cover up cigarette smell in the room. It was a dark room and not very inviting. We returned to reception and got another room, an upgrade, and they were very polite about it. Obviously, the upgrade made a big difference in our stay. The room was bigger, facing the garden with a good view and with an excellent bed. They do tend to provide only plastic water bottles in the rooms but I think people should be given the option of changing to a jug of water so that we can reduce plastic pollution.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
abdullah alangari,i stayed in this hotel from 8.8.2019 to 10.8.2019 this hotel is not even a three star its badly managed and the duty manager Jubran is very rude to customers i had a guest visiting me in the hotel with product samples the duty manager through him out of the hotel and wanted to through me out too if he could.The rooms are below the average 5 star and hotel is not worth the money period,2,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Then at the counter I was told no guarantee for the second day room. I was charge extra then what rate was given to me at  the hotel website. It’s not fair and please go some where else.

Hotel is very centrally located and is considered by many one of the safest in the city. Hotel has a wide range of restaurants and rooms are clean and well-equipped. Room service and cleaning working well! :)  For some reason, it is very hard to get coffee on the breakfast service. Plenty of waiters but everyone seems to play busy with relatively low efficiency.

Water from the shower leaked all over the bathroom. At night, the air conditioning didn’t work. They sent a building engineer to fix it but there was no improvement.    The next morning at breakfast, staff directed us to sit at a table with the previous dirty dishes still there.    We brought up these concerns upon check out, and staff was disinterested. I detailed them in my e-mailed survey, and got a generic response from management that didn't address any of them.    For the amount I paid, I expected much more.",2,Islamabad Serena Hotel

I have been traveling since 14th January from One End of the World to here. When I checked in last Evening I have precisely told the front desk staff that i am expecting few guests in the morning but have been replied bluntly that guests aren't allowed due to Covid and Security reasons.

Fahad T,"The moment you enter this hotel there is a smug feeling all around. From the guards to the reception owners. The security is so high that non-white individuals will be forcefully patted down if the beeper goes off for any reason. I myself have stayed at this hotel thrice in the past two months and having experienced this discrimination I am forced to alert other members of this community.   Other than this, the hotel is clean and the guest staff is humble but not humble enough. They would call at 11PM and alert you about your check out in a very rude manner. They bargain the checkout times even with corporate customers as if they will never check out of their fancy rooms. Such a shame that Pakistan’s only proper 5 star is represented by a bunch of unprofessional people.   Also,…",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Gabi07,"Serena hotel is a good choice when you are on business in Islamabad. Rooms are spacious with a seating area, a desk and an extra cabinet. The beds are extremely comfortable. Bathrooms are equipped with a shower and a bathtub. I stayed in room 439. Whilst I couldn’t hear traffic, I did hear my neighbor coughing for White some time.. a bit annoying to be honest since there wasn’t even a connecting door.   Breakfast has a lot of choices, however if you are dairy intolerant you might want to bring your own food. Not much to choose from then.   Service is attentive and friendly. We had a mix up with our conference room requirements and whilst one of the staff disappointingly rather focused on justifying himself another female colleague was extremely helpful and found a solution.

The hotel is beautiful and the rooms comfortable. My only complaint is that even though I have requested a room on a higher floor in advance, when I have arrived, the room is not available. Also I was surprised this time that the heat did not work in my room - apparently its common as they gave me a space heater since they couldn't fix it. They have a nice gym as well.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The rooms were large and luxurious, a daily newspaper was delivered to your door each morning, and fresh fruit each afternoon. The beds are large and comfortable, and came with a menu of pillows so you could pick according to your preference.   The bathrooms are large and clean and come with lots of complementary items.

That's why, when I evaluate them now, I am writing with some annoyance. They seem to have got a few basic things wrong in my last visit and didn't bother to want to fix them or change them, or apologize, or write back when I wrote to them.   Things they got wrong.   1. I had requested a room to be ready 10 minutes earlier than I was expected on the phone before I arrived. I was told that would be easy. When I arrived though, it obviously wasn't very easy.

Each single detail - from Multan pottery to china and cutlery, to marble floors, to staff uniforms - is chosen with great care and attention to esthetics. The service is flawless. There is a great variety of excellent food to choose from. One can just seat in the lobby and enjoy the tea or seat in the garden, which is a delight in itself. For those who like to exercise, the gym and the pool and the spa are top notch. Overall, an unforgettable experience. I do have one one suggestion to the hotel management: please open a store with Multan pottery, hand painted tin objects and other wonderful crafts Pakistan has to offer, but a busy traveler might have no time to search for in Islamabad.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Free laundry was provided with my room, which is always appreciated.  Good tv channels available in the room.

RSantos_15,n.b.  This review is targeted at the traveler for business or pleasure who has some experience in the region.  A five-star rating is rather elastic but this property deserves it.  I have now been to the Serena in Kabul and Islamabad and can testify that the Serena chain of hotels are indeed of high quality.    It's even good value for money as the room charge is well offset by the cheap food (which is delish) prices. I am definitely a foodie and found the food to be well above competent.  A real attention to detail like making maple syrup available for pancakes is the mark of a true service-oriented hotel.  All regional dishes from Western to South Asian and Asian were authentic tasting.  Only suggestion would be to get a Starbuck's - style espresso maker because the espressos I…,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Samra Muslim,Love the hotel and its little bits of comfort and security they offer to the guest but at times I felt it was too silent and dead (or maybe thats just Islamabad!!!). For sure the best place to stay in Isloo if you can afford the steep price ... !,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
mcrboy,"I arrived in islamabad at 2 in the morning . I had driver from the hotel come to receive me.  Security . Slightly ott (over the top). You can't even drive past it they've blocked off the road. So no taxi are permitted to enter shame really as normal taxi charge a few hundred rupees, serene charges start from 750 rps . Per hour for there cars and further 35per kilometer.   On the bad side my 2yr old daughter joined me at the hotel there was nothing for her to do. No park. No swings. Not even a small play area for kids .   Good. Zamana restaurant was outstanding buffet nice tasty food.  Defiantly if you have lots of cash to spend and need beefed up security . Then this place is for you . But anyone with family beware very pricey",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
trentonmakes,"This is a five-star hotel that is elegantly designed and with virtually every amenity, and a staff that is responsive, warm, and exceptionally friendly.  By Pakistani standards it must seem outlandishly expensive, though Westerners will likely find the pricing fairly reasonable for such consistent quality.   It is secured behind elaborate antiterrorist screens, which for the visitor during Pakistan's current travails is undoubtedly a good thing.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
ipbsln,"The Serena exceeds expectations in almost every category. Ever since they have expanded, the hotel looks stupendously magnificent. The staff is extremely friendly and goes out of their way to assist you, despite the fact that this is a very large chain hotel. The food is simply the best - the Zamana restaurant has unending choices, and the ambience is sublime. The rooms are great, comfortable and tastefully decorated in local Pakistani traditions. A resounding success, this hotel. Its a challenge to get into the hotel because of the massive security, but I can understand the concern they have.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Jaffy2010,"It is a decent hotel with spacious rooms but limited conference facilities. I was quite comfortable there except for the food as there were not many options for vegetarians.

They improved their services as per the feedback and felt satisfied.",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Fa K,"Have stayed in this hotel for seven days and six nights during late May 2010. The city of Islamabad is proud of having the highest possible security measures throughout the city for the guests of this hotel, particularly after that terrorist attack to the 5* Marriott hotel back in 2008. This could be a bit boring for the visitors to pass several (up to five!) security gates every day to enter the lobby. However, staying inside hotel gives a worthful feeling of security. Someone have described it as a modern fortress which is relatively true. External and interior views of Serena Hotel building is luxurious with a remarkably large open area and a mid-size swimming pool.  Interior design is adequately gorgeos and chic.

GeoMedic,"I spent 5 and a half days at the Serena hotel and I must admit I liked every minute of it. I was booked in to it for a five night stay but since my flight was a very late departure, I requested return to the hotel and took a day room rate for 4-5 hours of peace.  First, on most people's mind will be security. The road in front of the hotel is blocked off and used (apparently) only for hotel access. As you approach the hotel, the checkpoints become increasingly intrusive. The front side of the hotel is well fortified while the back, although somewhat less fortified due to the presence of a housing block (somewhat distant) is well guarded. All packages and people entering the hotel are screened. Few cars are allowed up the winding drive and no vehicle is allowed up if there isn't…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

We had a full day meeting in one of the meeting rooms, where the refreshments were appropriately provided for throughout the day.    The room was spacious well-kept.  The bathroom was infact too big and wasteful.  There was a hotwater problem at midnight, which took the engineering guy more than an hour to fix.  The internet apparatus in the room was either not working or was just too complicated to waste time on.  Check-in and check-out were OK too.  The food was good enough.

Haamid J,"It was our first experience and we were all delighted - excellent facilities, professional therapists with good communication skills, and friendly staff.  A word of caution and recommendation to the Serena Management.   A spa of international standing should  -  have an anti-skid mat inside the steam room, or else slippers for wet areas be provided; -  allow spa guests to use facilities like the steam room, sauna, pool and the gym within an hour of the therapy at no extra charge. Haider who, of course, is Hashoo trained, tried to charge for use of steam room, but at my retort, smiled and handed over the locker key.    Thankfully, he bent the rule and all in all it was a worthwhile Sunday afternoon relaxation.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Amazing really but needs to work on the breakfast ",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Jackneill10,"Well currently this hotel is packed with the ousted staff of the  foreign occupation force in Afghanistan on a exodus from Kabul. Hence a lot of jarheads, NGO nerds,  and old spy people. I had a reservation at Wild rice but me and my friends couldn't enter because of their no shorts policy (which is not listed anywhere). We ended up sneaking into the main dining hall where it was the buffet option. After we completed our meal the hostess came up to ""warn us that this was the last time they would let us in"" I was surprised at the hostility as it was aggressive. All of us were super polite and glad to be done with dinner. I was not impressed with the lack of manners and the buffet was mediocre.

The reception desk answers the calls after a very long wait, and there was not a single soul on our floor who could assist or guide. The adult swimming pool is at a floor where access to it is quite difficult. Different personnel guide you differently on how to get there, until you find out there is a separate elevator down the alley to get there.

There is little to dislike from my visits here, BUT there is one very big problem and that is customer care, or lack of. After having food poisoning here twice early last month and witnessing how little if at all the management here care, I will not be returning.

I have been to brunch before at Zamana, so this wasn't my first time.  My prior feedback is that while the food is good (albeit expensive compared to its quality) the service delivered to customers always leaves something to be desired.  Restaurant basics like approaching a table for drink orders soon after seating are neglected, plates are never cleared in a timely fashion--often piling up, and closing out a bill always lasts 10 minutes longer than it should.

The Serena is older but it reflects a more traditional elegance and ambiance.  The rooms have been upgraded and are meet all of my expectations.

At first we didn't think it would be good, but afterwards, we found out how good a hotel can be. It was enormous and it had a massive pool with many restaurant around the hotel. I recommend this hotel to all of you. This is the best hotel to go to in Islamabad",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Irm,"We stayed at the Serena hotel in Islamabad for 4 night   s,  our fourth stay. It is by far the best hotel we have stayed at in Pakistan. Standards are high, orderly set up,  excellent staff across the site - house keeping room service etc. Food  was excellent, we dined in Wild rice, presentation and taste of food was to a high standard. Spa was also wonderful- to European standards.   Fortunately we were upgraded to a junior suite which was nice and comfortable, especially the pillows and duvet! Thank you very much for for an amazing stay. We look forward to our return.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Upon check-in, all the staff I encountered along the way (helping with my bags, offering information about the hotel etc) were helpful and not overwhelming at all. The room was very clean and the laundry service was extremely efficient. I had attended a lunch reception there and the setup was beautiful, overall the hotel grounds itself is stunning and worth a walk around to explore. The food at both the reception and breakfast buffet were really good. In summary, great experience. ",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Littlesaint15,"The lobby is very grand indeed. The Serena’s grounds are beautifully kept, with views of the Margalla Hills as a backdrop. The exec lounge is a lovely space, with friendly service and excellent views - given those views , perhaps the Serena could put a few chairs and tables outside on the terrace? I really enjoyed the pool, heated perfectly for a November swim. My room was in a classical style, very pleasant and with a comfortable bed.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Tauseef,"it is one of the best hotel in Islamabad but not kids friendly, nothing for kids to do vs e.g. PC Bhurban. they can do a lot to make it family-friendly but i think they are geared towards businesses  in pros, their GYM and pool are very good.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The room was amazing also we were allowed vip entrance in to the business lounge  which was very impressive and made us feel very special. The hotel is fantastic lovely atmosphere.

Executive room also had a balcony and excess to Nazara Executive Lounge with complementary snacks, coffee, tea and juices from morning till night. Views from Nazara Lounge were simply terrific. There are seven different restaurants. We liked Rakaposhi the most. Food, service and environment was excellent. There are two temperature controlled swimming pools on ground and third floor, both are outdoor. I liked the one on third floor.  There are a lot of gardens where one can relax. Staff is friendly.

ZillNiazi,"Poor experience. Rude staff. Uncaring attitude. They will strip you down to your bags each time you enter the hotel. I stayed there for a week and I told them that I did not want to be frisked each time I entered hotel but they won't listen. They gave me a room that had an adjoining door and it was very noisy. I got the room changed but the air-conditioning wasn't working. They did not fix it for 7 days that I was there and it was HOT inside. Room service was too slow. I ordered for lemons one night at 9 p.m and they rang my bell despite ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door at 11 p.m. There are more stories to share over a span of 7 days that I spent there and none of them is pleasant.",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel
imzz79,"went with mrs for 4 days and just got back lahore 2 days ago infact and it was a memorable stay @ serena Islamabad 👌 we had a junior executive suite room; rooms were clean & in top shape ... best thing about the stay was we had 24 hours complimentary access to the nazara lounge (cafe top floor) which meant we could have tea, coffee, snacks, dessert etc. anytime of the day and it was all on the house 👍😎  the zamana restaurant (part of serena) was also top and we really enjoyed our breakfast buffets there. the 'baara dari' restaurant couldve been better though as it seemed abit under staffed.   Overall excellent stay!",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Ian M,"For a first visit to Islamabad this was not quite what I expected. It is the most stunning hotel with a cathedral like reception area with staff whose attitude is nothing is too difficult.  The bed was incredible, sinking into a mattress that engulfed you. The only fault i had was that the internet wasn't marvellous and at times unstable although with patience i managed to get done what I needed to. It has a very well equipped gym with great views.  The one thing that did disappoint was being shown to a table at breakfast where i left my bag and jacket to go to the buffet. On my return my bag and jacket had disappeared and someone else was sitting at the table i had been given. In 11 years of travelling for work i have never had this experience. It left me baffled and worried…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Patricia H,"I visited the Maisha Spa several years ago.  It is still my favorite worldwide. The dark mahogany massage rims are so relaxing, with a private bath, and rose petals on the floor so that you can inhale the sweet aroma of roses while face down on the massage table. The  1 and 1/2 hour facial with Mubin was the best I ever had - better than anything in England, US, anywhere. She actually put me to sleep and my skin was absolutely so soft and radiant - it was such a relaxing experience.  Pure bliss!!",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
kgruberman,"We were invited to Islamabad to participate in the IIUI Critical Thinking Forum. Since our hosts weren't paying for us to come, we tried to find some affordable accomodations via Airbnb. However, our friends at the US Embassy there told us ""we REALLY prefer that all American citizens stay at the Serena. It's the only place we can guarantee that's safe."" So we did … and it was the right move.  First off, the security there is first-rate, as diplomats from dozens of countries routinely stay there! Second, it's just a great hotel: well-run, caring staff, great amenities, and the best part was the amazing food choices in the primary restaurant there. Don't misunderstand: I'm not a food snob, nor do I only want food I'm familiar with. I love and embrace local cuisine wherever I go.…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Joe M,"The hotel is frequented by a lot of business travellers and foreign diplomats and with the French, British and American Embassies in close proximity there is a large security presence here which helps you feel secure at night.  Having traveled around Islamabad and up into the mountains in Murree for lunch, there is a large security presence but it's not imposing or threatening as a visitor in my opinion.  The hotel is luxury, there are a number of facilities here and caters for a number of different visitors.  There is an executive lounge, roof-top swimming pool (didn't try but looked good & clean), gym etc.  Breakfast was delivered to my room (was working so didn't want to go down for breakfast).  There were a lot of mosquitos around but fairly docile at this time of year,…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Matthew P,"I stayed here for a few nights to help recover from an illness. It was nice and relaxing and the pool was pleasant to sit by. Comfortable rooms, very pleasant and helpful staff.  I can't really comment on the restaurants because it wasn't worth eating anything as it wouldn't stay down for very long. However, the smells coming from Wild Rice were very pleasant.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Lulu,"This hotel is a self containing compound. It's possible to spend several days within the hotel. It had shops, several restaurants and gardens to stroll through.  The Pakastani restaurant on the first floor is my favorite.  The food is well prepared and the chef will even make special dishes by request.   The Internet is painfully slow in the rooms and will require patrons to go to the lobby for faster access.  It takes a while to get through to the reception too.  During this stay, I had to get a piece of luggage fixed.  The concierge fixed it for me without any problems and the charge was so minimal, I almost couldn't believe it. ",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
BLA07,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess to being a huge fan of the Serena hotel group.  The Islamabad Serena Hotel is the 9th hotel in the chain at which I have stayed.    I have found my new favourite Serena.  I try to imagine coming to this Serena in times before security was a paramount concern.  Coming off Constitution Avenue and simply driving up to the front entrance must have been spectacular.  As it is, once you have cleared all of the security checks, it is still an amazing entrance.  And then, once inside, you are treated to a wonderfully amazing lobby, absolutely gorgeous.  The staff at check-in and check-out were great; the concierge and greeting staff were extremely welcoming.

The hotel is surrounded in beautiful gardens and a stone's throw from the Diplomatic Enclave.   The lobby level restaurant serves buffets and a-la-carte Pakistani and international food. Go for the brunch, a sure value.   Security is quite high at the Serena, although be aware it remains a target.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Khaled Abdelwahab,"I stayed at the hotel during a 1 month business trip on Jan/Feb 2013.  By far this is one of the best hotels I've ever been to, here's why:  - Staff is great, very welcoming and helpful, they speak good English so communication isn't an issue. After some time at the hotel most of the them already knew our faces and would personally greet us (especially those at Zamana restaurant)  - We used the business center a lot, it has all the facilities you need, you just need to reserve in advance  - When not in any business activities I'd spend most of my day at the spa/pool/gym.

bennyboy2007,"When staying in Islamabad it was always a tight call between the Marriott and the Serena. Tighter security and the ability to buy alcohol always gave the Marriott the edge. However, that's changed now. Not only has security at the Serena been stepped up (but by no means to an oppressive level) but alcohol is now available to non-muslim guests. I was able to buy alcohol in my room and also in the Dawat restaurant. Add to this the very pleasant atmosphere and decor in the hotel and the friendly, if a little zealous, service and the Serena is now my number one choice when staying in Islamabad.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Located next to the diplomatic enclave and near most of the top  federal offices, it is now a days almost isolated with security layers and measures due to terrorist threat.

Roy W,"Located in the Diplomatic sector, the Serena Hotel offers an area of calm in the bustling neighbourhood that is Islamabad. The hotel rooms are spacious and well equipped. There are a number of different restaurants offering a range of cuisines. The buffet restaurant is particularly worth a visit, the selection of foods is vast. The facilities at the hotel are reasonable, but the electrical supply is inconsistent with several outages during my two week stay.  The staff are friendly and courteous. The security is strict (it has to be) and efficient. The down side is the amount of stairs that you have to climb from where your car drops you off to the hotel entrance.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
AlfredDC,"I stayed at Serena Hotel with my colleagues and ate mostly in Zamana restaurant. It was a very nice experience. It was my first trip to Pakistan and I cannot explain how much I liked the hospitality and courtesy offered by Serena staff. Zamana restaurant manager, Mr. Waqas is the one that really made our stay over there a wonderful experience. That guy really knows how to handle complains and treat guests like kings and queens. I mean we all were so much impressed by his professionalism and kindness that I would recommend all to stay in Islamabad Serena Hotel and do eat at their Zamana restaurant as the food and service is exceptional. p.s. look for Mr. Waqas if you like to make your trip memorable.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Drumadd,"The reports of the situation in Islamabad and the wider Pakistan will concern many and likely influence the decision not to go.  I would however, encourage business travellers to go to Islamabad and Rawalpindi and recommend this 'luxury' hotel.  The hotel contrasts local influences with expected standards for the experienced international business traveller very well. 5* price, nearly 5* facilities.  The security environment surrounding the Serena is the best I have seen in any country in the Asia/SE Asia region.  You will not be under threat from any attack as the hotel (and the city and airport) have responded magnificently to the experiences suffered by the Marriott and indiscriminate attacks.  I have been in CT for over 30 years and whilst shades of Belfast come to mind, it…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

GlobetrotterBangkok,"I stayed here for a week or so on business, but had to check out a couple of days earlier than planned for urgent business reasons. The hotel insisted on charging for an extra night, as a penalty for early check-out. I have never come across this before in years on the road as a business traveller.  What was worse, when we complained, the attitude of the duty manager was arrogant and dismissive. He didn't really care. ""Tough"", was the best way of paraphrasing him. The hotel is well located, secure, clean and the service generally is good, but all of this was completely undermined by this experience.

Bathroom fixtures and fittings are visibly worn out and need renovation, not a good look for a top end hotel.

Old style ethernet connection is still in the room though boards are all loose and falling out.

Options on the buffet were limited 90% not eatable.  Also no one was there to guide us at the reception. Our hosts guided us to the right place.,2,Islamabad Serena Hotel
gsa-29,The Serena is located close to the government offices in Islamabad but since traffic is only really an issue during the rush hour it is well located for getting around the city and only 30 minutes from airport outside peak times. It is architecturally pleasing externally but the inside - especially the space from the lobby to the front desk and the main restaurant - are the real gems with towering spaces and balconies with dark wood trellis work.

They pick up us from the airport so it was really easy reach, reception was smart, quick and bellboy was so respectful and friendly. Zamana restaurant was very chic and exotic decorated with wonderful scene, waiters were sincere and helpful, foods and beverages were delicious and stomach friendly(this is important in the east). The meeting rooms were wide and technologically sufficient for a proper international meeting, met all expectations. There were several different cousins in the…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Glen O,"Serena Hotel in Islamabad is a little out of the centre of things but it provides an excellent service with very good accommodation.  Its rooms are quite luxurious and have good quality bedding and linen. The hotel service is of a high standard and the overall cleanliness is good for Pakistan.  It has a very serene ambience and whether for business or pleasure, the hotel offers all the necessary support.  Relative to other hotels in the vicinity it is expensive - but in many ways, superior.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Ghaznavi612,"Excellent rooms, very good housekeeping, and delicious food, very courteous staff. I can say without any doubt Sareena Islamabad is among 10 best hotels in the world. Specially in winter it's sunny lawns are heaven for Europeans.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
AnthonyPermal,"Serena Hotel is Islamabad's jewel in the rough. For foreigners and Pakistanis like, not many realise just how luxurious and 'up there' this hotel really is. From the majestic palace-like facade and building, to the service quality and the rooms, you'd be forgiven if you woke up in their bed the next morning thinking you were in Dubai's best.  My favourite aspects of the Serena Hotel are their high tea and their outdoors. The high tea is truly special, with a blend of British treats and local pastries and the outdoors are particularly a pleasure in the rainy season, with low clouds gracing eye levels and the surrounding hills creating a dreamy ambiance.   It's not cheap, it's not for everyone, but if you can, you must stay here.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Overall wonderful place to visit and stay at Islamabad.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
ohteoh,"Always happy to come here. Security is tight (that's a good thing), staff are friendly but not over doing it. Only complain was that the room was freezing even with the a/c turned off.  Great pool and there is a nice courtyard with lots of greenery if that's your thing.  ""Wild Rice"" is their Asian cuisine restaurant where one can get Indonesian,  Chinese, Thai & Japanese food. When one is a ""Jack of all trades"", it ain't going to be great - the sukiyaki was terrible. Better off in the lounge restaurant where they have a great buffet",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Zeeshan K,"I have stayed at Serena many a times and the best thing about the hotel are its in-room amenities. The remote controlled lights, tv, Air conditioner are great. Bathrooms are well kept and clean. Rooms and bathrooms are spacious. They have the best breakfast buffet in Islamabad. Their food is great although a little pricey. The hotel doesn't really have any good views except the swimming pool area. Their outdoor, heated pool is nice and has a bar and lounging area as well. The changing rooms have lockers which is not very common in Pakistan.   The spa at Serena is expensive but totally worth it. Their masseuse are fully trained and are mostly foreign.  There are shops in the hotel as well but as i usually stay there when i'm on business, i don't really get the time to eat at…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

When I return to Lahore later this year, I will definitely stay at the Serena.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
pearl469,"Since this was meant to be one of Pakistan's best hotels, I am very disappointed to say it could have been better. Airport pick up was a shambles. Recieved a different meal to what we had ordered. And tooo much priority is given to security, so much so that it effects the customer service. A balance is needed. Ordered an ironing table for use, it was so dirty that we decided it was best not to iron. Revolting.  Plus points are that the reception is nicely designed, however the bedroom designs are quite dated reducing ones overall serenity and comfort. Breakfast was good, though the dinner was better (don't get the pakistani cuisine anywhere else in the world). Nazara lounge was a great place to relax and enjoy tea after dinner.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
mb5Ams,"I had a choice of The Marriott or The Serena when working in Pakistan recently. I choose The Serena based on tripadvisor reviews and colleague feedback as I never leave these things to the travel agency. The 2 top hotels in Islamabad are not cheap by any standards. I paid US 350 / night + local taxes. This is normal I guess in these areas.  Many things have been said about the security getting into the hotel but once used to the routine it was no issue. It's also well guarded inside the main entrance gate which gives you a reminder of where you are.  The inside entrance to the hotel is very well laid out with high cellings and lots of space. You just think, wow, not bad. The check-in was smooth and I was shown to my room by guest services.   The rooms are spacious and tidy. A…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Fahad A,"Undoubtedly the best hotel establishment in pakistan but they've taken hospitality and service to a new LOW. Have been staying here for 4 days now and 80% of the interactions that I have had with the staff have been disappointing. The guest calling services are disjointed and almost always late, the staff is not well informed or well groomed and worst of all, no one's smiling.   Staying at Serena used to be an awesome experience, but unfortunately they seem to have forgotten the difference between hospitality and accommodation.   Hope they find their soul back!

Salaar A,"Best hotel in islamabad and probably in the pakistan. Rooms are excellent; clean and spacy, pool is okay as is the staff. Food is not that impressive.

Belgravia01,"Had the Hotel booked for me through my Company so had no idea what to expect.  Was picked up from the Airport by the complimentary car (at 2am).  Arrived at the Hotel to a lot of security.  Once in the hotel felt very safe.   Its a wonderful hotel, very spacious and created in a way that make it almost Palatial.  Rooms are very well appointed.  The Hotel is completely surrounded by walls so walking out in the grounds is very safe. I stayed for 3 nights.  The breakfast is great and the room service is great.  As I like running i got a driver to take me to to the near by hills where there are several Walking / Running trails.  I went to Margalla Trail number 3 which takes you to the top of the hills where you can see the City.   Had a great time in Islamabad..  Would recommend..",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Any newly married couple should stay here!",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Sanna V,"This time it was my third visit to Serena and I was very happy to see that it persists to offer the same charm and feel to it. Such a beautiful establishment with extremely friendly and professional service. The tight security enables you to feel relaxed, the spa is of good quality, though quite pricey. Breakfast has good variety and the a la carte restaurants are of good quality with great attention to detail. The bakery is very nice and the attached outdoor space is indeed very pleasant. The changing art expositions bring a great twist to the hotel, whereas the shops offer interesting objects but with outrageous prices.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
GoodOscar,Nice and clean and a fantastic gym (health club) and pool - and would have been a five but poor wifi which is a must if you're there for work and therefore a four.

Quiet rooms, well maintained gardens and view on the Margalla hills add to the experience. The one hotel in Pakistan I can really relax. Great breakfast, good wifi and a full complementary mini-bar. The spa is nice but quite pricy.   ",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Sohail161,This is arguably the best hotel in Pakistan. It's right next to the parliament and government do security is tight.  It is expensive but you get what you pay for. Amazing interior and good choice of restaurants. Not sure if live music happens such as qawali in faisalabad sarena?  Our Pia flight was delayed 12 hours as usual and hotel was nice to let us stay till 5pm ratter than the usual 11am checkout.,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
C23007,For Pakistan standards this place is obviously with quite a distance one of the most luxurious places to stay.     Soon new 5 star hotels will likely be opened in Islamabad and my sense is this hotel at that stage will lose out in the long run as they take too many things for granted.  After arriving late and being jet lagged I hit my bed to find out in the morning that the sheets hadn't been changed from the previous guest. When the morning light came through my window I saw the sheets were very dirty. I informed management immediately and the duty manager couldn't even be bothered to come and apologize in person. In fact I needed to call 3 times before the lady could be bothered to give me a call back and her response was: we'll come and change the sheets now.  There is 2…,3,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The first morning I was asked if I wanted tea or coffee when I was seated, but nothing arrived until I had followed up two times and got a bit grumpy with the service supervisor who asked if everything was OK.  The tea arrived after I had finished breakfast. The next morning I wasn't asked, after spending some time trying to get attention I had to go and grab someone's attention to get a cup of tea. When I ordered room service (I was too ill to go downstairs) I was told it would take 25 to 30 minutes (for a meal that required no cooking) nothing arrived until after I followed up after 50 minutes. I could go on but....",2,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Dan R,"I loved staying at the Serena Hotel. High security when entering but this is necessary. The rooms were comfortable and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay including complimentary soft drinks and a pillow menu. Breakfast was amazing with a wide range of choices, I always went for the fresh Puri and Pakistani Cuisine. The executive lounge offers High Tea and food 24 hours a day and is a lovely place to relax  or work in. I highly recommend the Serena Hotel for anyone visiting Islamabad. As a solo female traveller staying in the hotel, it was very comfortable. The WIFI connection was great and was free. I also enjoyed listening to the musicians performing traditional music on the way to breakfast each morning.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
heddomcq,"My only complaint about my room is that the lovely duvet is a bit scratchy. The restaurants are very good (better than average for hotel restaurants). The service is excellent. It did take me a while to find the executive lounge, which is lovely, quiet, with endless tea and coffee. And by the time I found the lounge, I was kicked out because of VIPs. So I moved to the business center, which is also quiet and comfortable. When visiting Islamabad, I always try to stay at the Serena.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Once in the hotel you will be delighted by the grand opulence of the chandeliers and marble floors and the intricate Pakistani woodwork. Check in is usually smooth -keep your passport handy.

From the wonderful staff (Jibran at the front desk was very helpful) to the breakfast area to the cleaning staff, everyone in the hotel were super friendly.   The room, king size deluxe, was over looking the pool and the garden area. The beds wer comfortable, the Ac was working and there was hot running water.

You cannot imagine our disappointment when we were confronted with the change of room and change of choice in terms of the items available. The scarce options available were badly cooked and badly presented! We were expected to go up some steep steps to the area for the buffet High Tea - however there was no disable access and we had 2 guests with us who struggled to navigate the steep staircase.

Staff were incredibly polite, and very attentive to any queries that we had. Breakfast was top notch, with a wide variety of options. However what I found most reassuring was the level of security of the hotel. Multiple security check procedures for each and every person entering the hotel gave me another level of comfort knowing that we were staying in a secure place, especially given the situation of the country.

The room was excellent, the staff were very friendly and the restaurants were good quality and reasonably priced given the expense of a night. The gym was much better than many I've experience in expensive hotels and the pool was lovely.  My issues were minor - many of the TV channels were frequently frozen, the breakfast service was quite haphazard, the pool attached to the gym/spa seemed to be more of a leisure pool than an exercise pool (a division would have been nice) and the cost per night seemed a bit much.  It felt like the expense was due to the captive audience as I've experienced equally good hotels for far less.  I would recommend to anyone visiting Islamabad though.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

I have stayed here a few times and the rooms are above average size and generally well appointed-although a few are looking a little tired so a refurbishment might be due.

The food offerings are generally very good with the generic buffet restaurant providing an extensive menu and the Middle Eastern restaurant extremely good and quite authentic feeling.

Its hard to fully articulate everything that this hotel does to make your stay pleasant - little things, behind the scenes. Its got all the standard stuff that you'd expect from a high end hotel. But what I remember most are the smells - the tireless efforts of the staff to keep fresh cut flowers everywhere. Its very subtle, but it brightens your mood.  Unfortunately, I was in Islamabad during protests, and the hotel was largely empty.

AhmedAbdullah121,I travel regularly to Islamabad and stay at Serena hotel. Recently to my surprise I saw plastic mats in their new Sauna. I was shocked! . As when plastic interacts with heat of such high temperature certain fumes are evaporated in the air ( like benzene) which causes cancer. I would request the management to immediately remove them and save their guests from health hazards.,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Vasiha Begum,"The hotel is a five star property that is living up to its rating.  Very elegant  and the most prestigious address and with full facilities. The hotel has well guarded security and is the safest pace to stay. The staff is very courteous but one has to  get the attention of the front desk and the waiters at the restaurant. The staff needs to be obliging and alert towards the customers needs who are the revenue generators.  I""m sure once they are reminded of their duty they would be very pleasing as they are so welcoming.  The hotel is very comfortable and has exclusive and exquisite restaurants which have ethnic  ambiance. I just loved my stay and enjoyed the serene hospitality of Serena.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Shaiboo,"I stayed at Hotel Serena few days back for one night alongwith my family at Islamabad. The hotel has a beautiful lush green and flowery landscape and nice traditional interior. The food was good and staff in general was cooperative. However, I had to face very disgraceful & discriminatory treatment at the two pools of the hotels, when I went there alongwith my daughter. We were wearing swimming costume but of course not the one which was being sold at the hotel. I was wearing Adidas sports short (branded as Climalite- made of a very thin fabric & dries up quickly) which I had been using at other five star hotels' pools in different countries but I was not allowed by the Serena Hotel Pool attendant on the pretext that it is not a proper swimming costume and as per their G.M.'s…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The rooms seem to be ok at first glance, however the carpets are now dirty, the sofas in the rooms and executive lounge are worn and dirty, one of the power sockets in the executive room was also broken.  Booking a chauffeur for the day was easy was good although rather expensive.  The breakfast and food was superb.  The head concierge was very helpful.  I got annoyed a few times, once waiting for bed sheets, once waiting for water, once for tea. The swimming pool lockers were missing slippers or towels.

I encountered problems from day one paid for an executive suite where the air conditioning was not working throughout the week. It remained on cold .

Other than that as last time i would definetely stay in Serena in my next visit to Islamabad",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The location is great for getting to and from the airport, the diplomatic and government offices etc…  Obviously this is not a time to be walking around as a foreigner to and from your hotel, but there is a small park right next door.

My only complain is about service, terrible serice of rooms and housekeeping. If you found a telephone set in room there is no number mentioned of house keeping. You always have to call on reception or guest relations and ask them to forward the line to housekeeping. And once u spoke with housekeeping and requested something they might forget and no one never came. The minimum time is half hour if u requested dental kit for example. They need to improove the service. I would better stay in Marriott next time rather then Serena",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Overall it feels like you are not in Pakistan rather in an advanced city of Canada/US or Europe. However, tight security checking at the entrance is a bit odd in all evens. It is a bit expensive if you are coming from within the country but may not be that much expensive if you are coming from outside like Canada/US/Europe. Overall it feels nicer in the presence of great green look of Margall hills. I would recommend this hotel to be worth visiting and staying.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
DanishFIqbal,Stayed in Islamabad Serena last weekend with my family. The housekeeping staff took five hours and numerous calls to put a mattress for my daughter in the room. Makeup room service ended up cleaning our room around evening time and they forgot to put fresh towels which came after two calls to housekeeping staff. Our floor had some military delegation so all exit doors were kept open for surveillance making access to the room very hot and corridors hotter. There was no privacy as well. Instead of putting us on the same floor the hotel management could have booked us in a different floor to save us from all this hassle.

The food at every one of their restaurants was excellent and the service was impeccable. The car service was also very good, albeit a bit pricey.

The wireless Internet service has very little reception in the rooms and is extremely slow (though this is a problem in the country). The reception is understaffed and it takes a long time to check-in/check-out. The reception staff and waiters in the Zamana restaurant need training for customer service.

Open buffet breakfast is also very good and tasty. Wi-fi connection changes time to time regarding in which room you stay.

The only thing I think could improve is communication - I had a bit of difficulty making myself understood. But overall, a lovely place to stay, closely located to key places in city.

Gziro,"I stayed several times in Marriott in Islamabad and it was my first stay in Serena Islamabad...  Staff and service is very friendly and dedicated. Sometimes their excessive care was even disturbing.   Several places with different cuisine - very valuable if you prefer all time to stay in hotel (as advised by security situation). Prices in restaurants are lower than expected - 20-25$ to enjoy local dishes...  Cons: poor internet.... although Wi-Fi connectoin is stable (at least in my room and most of areas), communication beyond the gateway is unreliable (10x varatin of ping round rip times, frequent lost packages), but is still sufficient for exchanging emails.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

laurent t,"Serena hotel is one of the best in class places to stay with the Mariott, but the traditional pakistanese style makes the Serena hotel much more beautiful. If you remember the video game Prince of Persia, well, Serena hotel looks like this, plus it has very beautiful gardens and when the weather is hot it must be very nice to go there. Staff is super friendly, very helpful. You get complimentary airport transport anytime. The rooms are big, very clean, beds are very comfortable. Many restaurants but it seems everybody goes to the main one with the big buffet. I have to say that the food is rather average, not bad but not super good as well. For breakfast it is OK, but for dinner you might want to try something else. I did not try the room service though. Overall experience is…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

winxalot,"This extraordinary hotel is a destination, not simply a place to stay while in Islamabad.  From the moment I arrived until the moment I departed one week later, I truly felt like a guest, rather than a customer. The care with which the hotel is maintained equals its grandeur. The extraordinary knowledge, skills, and attitudes of each and every staff member is a benchmark for any organization in the world.    I recommend staying on the Executive floor. The halls are a bit cleaner.  There are fewer wedding party guests roaming the halls n the evenings. The included services of the Business Center and the availability of a free high-speed and consistent LAN connection for your internet more than compensate for the moderate extra cost.

It seemed that the management had adopted a GO SLOW POLICY  whether it was provision of clean plates, refilling of dishes or serving tea or clearing table / used crockery.

There are a few food options, but none of them are great if you are looking for quality Pakistani food... the only real option is the buffet restaurant, and that was a bit hit & miss.

It's also a hotel the foreign visitors like the best. The food courts are very good. Buffet and La Carte menu both are served. Food is simply perfect in all respects.

I went to Wild Rice for dinner and the Manager was very helpful and friendly and we had a truly lovely meal. I think the highlight was definitely the breakfast buffet though, where I had some of the most incredible pancakes.

Waseemmahmood,The hotel is excellent but is let down by occasional bad service. The amount of time that one has to wait to get the simplest thing done and the numbers of calls one has to make to Guest Services for simple things like laundry collection can be irritating and not something that one expects from a five star hotel. The buffet dinner and lunch have a great selection of food but again let down by poor service. Had to wait nearly 30 minutes for bread and drinks to arrive. That being said the service in the Dawaat restaurant was exceptional...,4,Islamabad Serena Hotel

ckatsuya,"Don't get me wrong, the hotel is fine. Rooms are small and a bit tired - some stains on the sofa and carpet, but comfortable bed and very decent shower. The buffet breakfast is good and so is the grill restaurant outside. Security is also good, based on what I've seen in other places. ",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
RehanUK,"Recently stayed at this hotel and from the minute I entered the room it was disappointing.  Towels seemed to be in short supply. Water bottles were rationed.  We were served frozen lamb shank at the restaurant. Bakery cafe served horrible nachos. Price was one of the most expensive compared to the service standards.  I had to wait +4 hours to get iron, and then was told to give them to give it back as they were running short on irons.  It was shameful as I even informed the Front Office Manager who seemed out of touch.  Never to go there again, instead use Marriott, much better, relatively speaking.",2,Islamabad Serena Hotel
nchammmer,Ate there with some friends. Most of the items we ordered were good but not fantastic. Serving sizes were very large and we couldn't end up finishing our food. Pricing was not cheap for that cuisine as it really didn't have the culinary excellence of fine dining. I would hesitate to eat there again simply because there are better options available in the city. ,3,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Even with a lot of security around the hotel, the gardens and the swimming pools allowed us to see the surrounding area (unlike Marriot hotel).

Hotel environment is still excellent but it is very sad to say that the service was not good and food hygiene is not a standard as we noticed many tasteless food items in morning buffet.  We met with a Sous chef handling Zamana restaurant Mr. sajjad ghouri belongs to Punjab Lahore who trying to work hard but not happy anymore in Serena hotel as he said, the bad behavior from other staff like executive and corporate chefs.

Didn't feel like a luxury hotel experience which it should at the price paid. ",2,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Murtaza S,An excellent stay. Very good location. I had asked for room with a good view. The view I guess was good but the room was too far inside. But we didn't mind that.  We couldn't bring the car upto the lobby but they had Vallet service for that which was good enough.   We had the holiday package which was very good more such packages should be offered around the year. We had daily breakfast and a free dinner.  I have to say that the food quality and taste wasn't excellent they need to work on this department a little more. Other that on first night the heater didn't work I didn't realize that. But on the second night it was extremely cold but house keeping staff came in and fixed issue.  The room was clean. The fittings were upto date enjoyed my stay here ,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The services are expensive by Pakistan's standards but you pay for luxury in a secure location that no other hotel offers in Islamabad.

Their currency is the rupee which comes to $1 = Rs. 85 and yet they charge more than a 5 star American hotel.. - they lie about different types of rooms. deluxe and executive and club are all the same. I checked.  They are all the same size, same decor, same layout.  But charges are noticeably different as can be seen on online reservations. - Executive Lounge has only biscuits and some pastries, nothing more.

rehanhaque,"This was my 3rd time staying at Serena Islamabad, 2nd in 2 months.  In January, I was participating in an annual conference.  The group was very large, and we were sharing rooms.  Unfortunately, my takeaway from that trip was the always-out-of-order door cards for the room, and the horrible water management in the washroom.  In February, the door cards were fine, but the bad plumbing persisted.  For some reason, every time one uses the washroom, there is water on the floor.  I even complained to the desk person checking me out, but he seemed to have brushed that aside.  I'm not impressed and next time, I will be trying our the Marriott.",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel

Outside of my very first visit (Feb 2019), the quality of service seems to have rapidly deteriorated, and thus the rudeness has dramatically increased. During my first visit, our check-in experience was impeccable - I didn’t have to specifically call the valet to park the car, I didn’t have to ask several folks to assist with taking luggage upstairs, I got exactly what I expected with the price I paid. Since then, and specifically today (Dec 2021), it’s been one rude and inattentive service member after another.

Every staff member I have dealt with has been incredibly helpful and patient. The heated swimming pool with a view of the city is a wonderful feature, especially if you like to swim early in the morning -- its is beautiful. The business centre can help you with any printing or meeting space. The only suggestions I could make is to offer more informal dining options for business travelers, and to make the rewards program easier to join/manage. Some of the rooms are more updated than others, so it is worth checking your reservation if this is important to you.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

The lounge on the top floor is also very nice and makes the place seem more comfortable for longer stays.

Service was mostly very good with some small hiccups in restaurants but generally well trained staff...we were a large group of 300 but well looked after...I would highly recommend…",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Rolf S,"I have stayed in this hotel for 2 nights. Before getting in you have to go to several security checks. It certainly gives a feeling of safety. The hotel is located close to the embassy district. It has 2 very nice outside pools, an excellent gym and great meeting rooms. Point of attention is the speed of checking in and out.

Sal_iqbal8,"My third visit to Serena and invited friends to experience the beauty and amazing service... Totally disappointing customer service and respect to guests from check in to arranging travel! A 15km drop off was charged at 2,570 rupees more that the cost of a black cab in London .. Outrageous .. No receipt from a Serena Car! Will NOT be coming back or recommending !",1,Islamabad Serena Hotel
znisa123,Great hotel. The food was fabulous. The buffet stretched for miles. Room was standard for a five star. Long security checks was the only downside and miles away from city centre!!! Lovely service and every request was met happily. ,5,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Amir K,"I stayed there for 2 days, it was a short stay and experience, but I felt comfortable there.  The staff were so professional, helpful, accountable and kind.  Rooms, restaurant, corridors, outdoor bathroom and elevator were kept clean and functional completely.  My room had a double (queen size) bed, which was so convenient. But the air conditioning system was somehow noisy, during bedtime I needed to turn it on for cooling the air, but finally I had to turn it off for the sake of calm and sleep. Also, its TV set was a modern one, but working with it was somehow complicated, not an easy job. The building was so big and I was lost there two times, on finding my way to room and getting out of the hotel; supposedly there is a need for installing more guiding signs in corridors, or…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
arifabrar,"Comfortable rooms and beds, wide selection of pillows and the best breakfast in Pakistan.The best play to stay for business travelers.  Have stayed here numerous times and never had a bad experience.  Room service food leaves a bit to be desired.",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
Kieran E,"The security requirements and cost to quality ration of the hotel make it poor value unless you are forced to stay here by your employer. The rooms are pretty decent and are clean, but nothing spectacular. The restaurants are adequate but poor by international standards, with little choice and lots of meat in oil, the sushi and asian options are very overpriced. The hotel has a great gym which would be recommended for short visits where travel is limited. The organisation itself appears to have one person to do one minute function, which can be very frustrating when trying to access reward points, get something sorted at a restaurant through the reception etc.",3,Islamabad Serena Hotel
tjb77London,"If you're coming to Islamabad on business you pick here or the Marriott. The breakfast is better at the Marriott and the gym is better at the Serena. So take your pick. The wifi is great, much better than the Marriott.  The inside of the hotel is grand and over the top, which gives it some charm. The grounds are lovely too.   Was in residence here for a few weeks on a work trip so I admit all hotels tire when  you're there for more than a few nights.   The service is very attentive but that doesn't equal good service. I think it's a cultural thing though because it's the same at decent cafes and at other hotels. Plates left on the table after you've finished, they takes ages to come for your order, get it wrong, and then come to see f everything is okay when you have a mouth…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
GlenWarburton,"The hotel is sumptuous - more so than Marriott.  Only my second time in Pakistan, was surprised and pleased to see a Christmas tree and decorations in the atrium, despite being an atheist.   Restaurants plentiful and very good.  The outdoor swimming pool, even in December was warm enough.   The staff try their hardest to make your stay welcome.  Breakfast is excellent, although sometimes it is quite hard to get a coffee, which seems to be a rare drink in Pakistan. There is no bar in the Serena - something the Marriott does have. Also, in the Marriott, you can order any dish from the hotel restaurants and eat them in the bar with a beer, which gives a modicum of normality for a Brit.  That said, the food is better in the Serena.  You can order a selection of drinks via room…",4,Islamabad Serena Hotel
joannainbristol,"I work in the aid sector and travel a lot with work. This is really an excellent hotel, for business or pleasure, in any part of the world. The rooms are very comfortable and there are nice touches (a pillow menu, good toiletries, free soft drinks). There are also nice facilities (a gym, outdoor pool and spa), a good breakfast and attentive staff.   There is a lot of security - as would be expected - around the hotel. This is a downside as the Serena is something of a target. But, I felt like good security measures had been put in place to mitigate against this.   Recommended. I will be staying here again.",5,Islamabad Serena Hotel

We called the reception for it and they said they would send it. Nothing came. The TV wasn’t working and we complained, nothing happened. Next day, we complained again. A staff member came to check and then offered to change our room. We were “upgraded” to a two bedroom duplex apartment on the 19th floor. The bedrooms are on the 20th floor within the apartment. We checked that the TV was working and cutlery was there. It’s the month of Ramadan so everyone is fasting. We were told that there is a buffet for Sehoor.

Every time the chef was asked for food by anyone, the standard response was that it is not available. Other staff then had to intervene.  As for front desk, it is the worst front desk staff of any hotel in the world. For someone who has spent around 170 nights with this hotel group, I would have expected much better. Not only are they extremely dry, slow, and incompetent,  they harass and insult the guest in front of others to cover their own shortcomings (especially Riaz Ahmed).

David shiran,I was there in this hotel for 5 days. When i came into the hotel around 830 in the morning i met two gentlemen Mr Ali and Mr Waqas they were very friendly and helpful. They were able quicky check me in and provide me a room. It was a wonderful gesture by these two staff.  Few drawbacks there was no electric kettle in the room which they informed that it is only provided to certain floors which i feel is not a luxury it is a basic necessity. The washrooms quite old need replacing. The  temperature in the airconditiner cannot be controlled it runs on 20 which is quite cold.  The food was good there was a wide spread the staff very friendly and helpful.,4,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
shiran811,"I arrived in the Hotel around 0830 on 16 Sept. I was met by Mr Ali and Mr Waqas at the front office. I was very impressed by the service offered to me by both of them.

The rooms needs repairs as it looks old specially the wash room. there was no electric kettle in my room , but on my request it was provided. As I travel a lot and have experiences staying in many hotels. every room has the basic amentias.

I complained and they sent a technician and found out that the filter was clogged..this only marginally improved the temp..VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,..  3) Bathroom & Bedroom:  a) The toilet seat had not been sanitized.. there was urine all over it.. b) the drain in the shower was blocked...had to call another technician later to fix it..he did a partial repair job because the drain again clogged up..…",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

They decided to charge extortionate rates and although I explained that they should have mentioned items in the fridge and the rates they completely ignored my suggestion and simply presented a bill. It seemed to me that they were solely interested in receiving the money. Not sure if they value customer and friendly service.

To tell you I was overall Satisfied with the Iftar Buffet Setup and in the price of Rs 1300/- Net I believe it was a good deal. I enjoyed the delicious food specially the Chicken Wings were just toooo good.  The only complaint I have is in regards to the space of Restaurant.

The staff is not so co-operative, hygiene is not a priority, food tastes just average especially if you go for a hi-tea & you choose the stick rubbery pizza slice, you will regret your choice, same hold true for vegetable Manchurian, Lahoree fish, chappal kabab etc. For dinner, you go to Bukhara where the food is being prepared & displayed in open air facility that makes it hard to go & get it in chilly foggy nights of winter or even if it's raining.

The price per night was about 17,000 PKR which is a 4-5 star price, and frankly overpriced for this property.  Security is excellent, to actually a bit over the top, with your bags being checked before you arrive on premise but then you're also made to wait for quite some time for your bags to catch up with you.

We were due to stay at many different places during the two week stay.  Had a lot of commitments including family wedding.   With a young child it is good to be well rested before boarding a long flight as children become agitated.  So we decided it better to leave one day earlier and stay in a hotel.

First there was no one at reception attending our calls to bring us water bottles at night and my husband had to go all the way to the lobby himself to  get us water. Also worth mentioning that they had very generously left only 2 250ml water bottles for a whole day's stay. Secondly the Temperature regulator was not working and the room was warm and humid throughout. The bathroom drain was not working. When I showered the water level kept standing inside the shower area and drained more than an hour later.

Room is very old, everything is very run down including the cupboards, tables, sofa, and the mattress is so old where you will sink in the middle when you slept on it. Room smells like cigarette smell the whole night and I couldn't even sleep with the cigarette smells. The main point I wish to highlight is the bathroom is extremely extremely poor. Water is not able to flush down the bathtub. Imagine I was having shower and the bathroom is filled up to my knees level. When I feedback this during check out, the reception just replied ""Ok"".

Naruto7860,"I returned after 3 years and the PC Rawalpindi has dropped its standards significantly . Upon arrival basics missing from room . The only power to charge devices was in the bathroom shaver socket - it can’t be hard to upgrade at least one room socket to have international adapter type installed. They also charge for the online reservation, charge you full price and then you have to hope they reconcile (last time same occurred and it took me emailing twice to get it resolved). The front desk foreign exchange currency rates are unethical priced . The only saving feature was that they still have a very good breakfast arrangement and quality has not slipped there. I always chose this hotel for its ideal proximity for my needs and activities but it’s probably not one I’ll visit again.",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Despite not being able to follow instructions (I need a family room; not a double room) and taking over 20 minutes to check in was beyond a joke. The executive club is rather small but is reasonable. The hotel hosts a lot of weddings and can be pretty rowdy and has kids screaming around the place - sometimes there is more than one wedding a day! The corridors are dated with scuffed carpets. The room rug/carpet is not clean. Wear slippers when you walk around your room. On the plus side, it is very secure and they take security extremely seriously.

Kashif Malik,I stayed in pc rawalpindi for two nights with family. The hotel claims to be five star but in reality it's not more than 3.5 star according international standards. I have attached photographs of the room. We ordered extra mattress which costs almost Rs. 2000 per night. It was in such terrible condition (pictures attached) that it seems a street sight 1 star motel. Above that service was terrible. These people don't understand meaning to providing luxury. I would not recommend this hotel. Instead marroitt Islamabad or serena Islamabad are much better option. ,2,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Swimming Pool is great to keep young and old entertained. The Pool was big and the staff kept it well maintained. ladies working there in the Pool area treated my kids like family. Can't say enough about the food. Amazing flavours and variety at all meals at the buffet restaurants. The a la carte restaurants were also very good and gave a more formal atmosphere. Rooms were modern, clean and had all the basic amenities. The music at Marco Polo Restaurant in the evening was  entertaining and the singers were very much professionals.

Hotel is situated at a nice location, very good security. Check in was smooth and the staff courteous. When I entered the room, I was horrified that the room floor didn't had a carpet or standard floor tiles, instead it had a mixture of floor chips and some weird shiny thing. That is something I have seen it first time in a hotel , let alone for a property that claims to be a 5 star. The house keeping and service staff were helpful. The food quality is just not upto the mark and very limited choices available. The heating vent in the room was noisy and didn't let me have a proper sleep.",2,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
hmalik,Popular High Tea. Busy restaurant. It appeared the staff management at restaurants were unable to serve all its customers properly.  Managers were seen walking around the room aimlessly without directing servers where service was needed or give a hand to busy inexperience staff.  I had to ask for tea few times before I was served. The cups were doll  size cups. Two or three sips & I needed more tea again. I had to get up & ask for tea service again & again. Finally when I asked one of the manager I was able to have a teapot brought over. PKR 1500 for two. Good atmosphere & large room overlooking the outdoor pool & health club.  With better service in mind I'll take my business to Mei Kong restaurant in Saddar bazar where I'm told service & quality are superior. ,3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Nadeem T,"For almost one month stay our experience at PC were very pleasant Beside one issue we made a booking locally and were quote much higher price about Rs.28000/- for executive room. When we spoke to Tahir Duty manager he told us that we can rebook a room at lower rate Rs.23000/- per night including tax. However, we had to pay for one night Rs.28000/- and we agreed. But at the time of checkout the charges were Rs.25000/- per night. I didn't want to make a big fuzz out of it and make the payment instead because I enjoyed good time at PC.

Lels,Stayed here with my family. Last time was 2008. It's not changed but all things considered it's better than most of the other hotels. Serena is obviously leaps and bounds ahead but then their prices reflect that. We had a steak at the restaurant there. It was pleasant. The bathrooms were tired and the staff not attentive.  The problem with Rawalpindi/Islamabad is they have no middle range hotels. They are either expensive for what they are or disgusting. There's a real niche in the market for a good standard of hotel that's reasonably priced. The PC Rawalpindi does not live up to the standards of its other chains in Lahore and Karachi. Security is overboard too. ,4,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
Usman A,Rooms look like 50 years old. Never renovated. Matress and beds r old and poor quality. Bath doors are of old broken wood partition. Bath accessories are out dated. Walls are so thin u can hear the people and television next door. It certainly is not 4-5star standard but rather a poor old hotel only. Should rather stay in newly built small hotel,1,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
Muhammad I,The bathroom was really grimy. There was hair in the  basin and the outside of the the bin was filthy. The tiles had visible dirt and marks on them.  We should have been offered a non smoking room as our room smelt like an ash tray. I dread to think of the state of the kitchens! ,2,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

The food was not so great as it used to be, some dishes were good and rest were not a pleasant experience. Specially the steam roast, it was not cooked from the inside. I thought maybe this piece didn't got well cooked but we were party of 8 and all of them had the same issue. I tried 3different pieces but all were raw from inside. One of us didn't liked the kulfi and asked for the suggestion book and after that manager was kind enough to come and check what the problem was.

Breakfast is NOT 5 stars and can be found at any 2-3 stars hotel, on top of that , you have to wait in the morning to be seated as they can not deal with all the guests. The company even booked a suite in order to get more service due to the hotels reputation. Will never come back and that goes for all my colleagues.",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

The bed was very comfy, a few lights didn't work in my room, none of the extra plug sockets worked, so I had to manually remove a light plug to charge my phone which meant the room was dark most of the time. The walls are very thin, you can hear everything from the rooms next to you. The complimentary fruit basket was always 2 bananas and a stale piece of fruit. Beware if you order anything from the menu, as the price quoted is always doubled, by the time the bill arrives and they have added tray charges, service charges, tax etc. It cost me 500rs for a cup of tea that didn't even taste nice. Also, the spa is a joke. Do not waste your money on a massage. The staff are…",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

The rooms cleanliness was average, aircoditioning was not adjustable. Bathrooms appear to 50 years old and made workable by lot of poor quality fittings in washbasin, and flush system.

Although I recalled stays at the Pearl Continental in Lahore and Bhurban a decade ago, I had never had an occasion to stay at the PC in Rawalpindi before this.  The entire experience was very good.  Check-in was respectful and efficient; the room was well appointed, generous in size, comfortable, quiet, and equipped with Internet (although the speed was a bit slow).  The hotel staff, from reception, to housekeeping to bell staff were helpful and responsive. The room was a treat, even though it was rated as standard.

It did the trick but TBH it made me feel a bit vulnerable, especially as the driver asked me a number of times where I wanted to go.

Maha I,"the pearl continental hotel  is a best hotel, it is quite affordable . i think it is good opinion for arranging parties and  weeding function over there because the space which they provide for the party is in all ways suites to your requirement the decor of these halls are done in both classic+modern ways so any type of function can arrange over there with every type of mood but i think the food is not as much as delicious that it can be  ,on the part of services they are good enough so on overall conclusion  this is good place to visit because some time at also organize traditional events on which traditional things with different culture is represented on same platform",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Fa K,"Stayed in the Pearl Continental for a day and night in late May. The hotel is located in a  silent and peacful neighborhood with a walking distance from the Pindi's market place. The external look of the building is a bit old, while the interior design has been renovated and looks good enough. A large area at center of lobby is taken for Reception desk, so there is not enough space for visitors to waste their time. Not to forget that the security is the most important issue in Pakistani hotels these days for foreign visitors. This hotel benefits from a mid-level security measures but not the highest, as provided by Serena Hotel of Islamabad.  In Pearl Continental hotel, security gaps were observed during my stay. One example was entrance of a big private truck (possibly known to…",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

It is located close to government offices  so your travelling time and distance are reduced. There are also a number of options for conducting business meetings within  the hotel.

No soda or any other drink.  It was the worst club room I have ever used.   Definately NOT worth the extra money.     I was not impressed with this dated hotel.  It was clean and comfortable, but the hotel is old and I did not like the ""serious"" nature of the property and staff.   It is a PC hotel, not the Burj al Arab.

Just that when we checked in, our rooms were very hot we felt we needed air conditioning.  But since the entire hotel is running on the same setup the hotel had turned of cooling due to winter season.

I loved the sports club for the fine Pakistani lady but I should say girl, who gave me a great massage. Something I never expected in Pakistan.   I paid $165 USD/Night. I say it is expensive.  The bed was not comfortable. (if you are none-smoker ask for a none-smoking room otherwise you will get your eyes burned, I changed my room the for the second night to non-smoking).  Noisy environment but it is Pakistan, so no complain. If possible, ask for a room with pool view (calm).

safi553,"Short review as I haven’t slept. I have been coming to PC Rawalpindi from the last 5 years due to my job nature being an airline captain. From customer service to improving themselves, this hotel just doesn’t care. I am writing this review while staying in one of the rooms. Due to the nature of my job, we need uninterrupted rest and sleep and they make sure you don’t get any.  When I checked in on 28th July, my room AC was not working properly for the whole night due to lack of cleaning and when I came back after flying for 14 hours. Renovation work was being carried out right above me without any prior notice. I asked the duty manager repeatedly if she could change my room or ask them to stop as I hadn’t slept for nearly 25 hours now! She conveniently said that no room is…",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
Umar Q,"I would advise against staying at this hotel under any circumstances. The service is pathetic - every touch point with their staff was extremely frustrating, the rooms are completely dated, you will keep calling and calling before any staff shows up for anything, and the problem still will not be resolved. Fundamental issues with the way that this property is being managed, clearly.",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
Shanzae Malik,"The Marco Polo Restaurant of PC pindi was wonderfully taken care of by the manager named ""Qasim"". He displayed great rapport with each customer and had genuine concern for each persons dining experience. Even though he was senior, he looked after every detail himself and went out of his way to make the customers smile and enjoy their meal. He personally carried out each task himself to give each customer a personalised experience. He handled everything gracefully from dealing with complaining customers to managing the waiters and the LIVE kitchen. Surely Qasim cares about the reputation of PC the most. PC is very lucky to have him. I had a 5 star experience because of him hosting my breakfast and lunch.  My rating is ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Although i have a pearl continental membership card but i have come to the conclusion its useless as their service was very poor at this hotel aswell as Muzaffrabad.

I find it totally unacceptable for staff to be chewing gum. It was rather like watching goats chewing grass. The venue was not great. The room, substandard. The bathroom was full of moulded and mildew. The balcony door was weak and I was afraid to open it in case it fell off. The view out of the hotel window is obstructed by a concrete structure.

The worst part to start with, their washrooms, the design is so impractical, commode is placed in such a squeezed place like a 2 star hotel trying to push in all the things together squeezed together. It is practically impossible for anyone to sit straight on the commode as it is so close to wall. The ramp from washrooms serves as a perfect trap for anyone to fall. The size of washroom is itself very very small. Unlike any 5 stars in Pakistan. The wash basin is hardly few inches away from the commode.

I also visited this hotel on an agreed rate however they required a larger payment at check-in and wanted pre- payment which I agreed to.

They told me they would refund the difference at the end of the stay. When checking out came they altered the agreed rate and refused to refund me the difference taking 25% more for no reason.

abbs786,I stayed in the Hotel for 4 nights. Very good for security. Good breakfast buffet options local and European. Rooms are clean and are made up everyday. Room service is excellent. There are many dining choices within the hotel. The electric does goes off but 30s later the generators kick in and there is no disruption. While in the hotel I did not feel that I was in Pakistan. The hotel is a preferred choice for many airlines crew and NGOs because of its close proximity to the airport.,5,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
carebears14,"I think it has become a custom in Pakistan that with time the quality starts to decline, and same happened with PC as well. I have been coming here since I was a kid and this time I was really disappointed at what the place has become. It ruined all the pleasant childhood memories which were associated with this place. The food was pathetic as well as their rooms. The only thing which is getting me to give this place 3stars is the service because the guy at the front desk was really helpful and he saved the leftovers of our trip.  I am not sure whether I would be recommending it to others or even returning back myself ",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
gobystolsvik,"Ok 4 star hotel in Rawalpindi. Close to the center in Rawalpindi but not as near to Islamabad.

One of the restaurants is a grill where you get local food grilled outdoors, this was a great restaurant.",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
sherpao,we used the hotel to stay overnight for a flight early in morning.we were staying with 2 children and one infant and to our greatest surprise we were provided only two single beds.despite reminding they were adamant they are double rather than single beds...i slept on floor to make some space for my younger son..... no tea was provided in room..even 2 to 3 stars hotel provide complimentary tea in room for their guests.. hotel provide airport transfer...but that was arranged after 3-4 reminders and waiting for extra 30 minute...doesnt suits a reputable '5 star' hotel.... Above all the initial charges for the room were £85 but additional taxes were added and it went to £98...amazing,3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Mahmoud Alsabbagh,"The hotel is way too old. I had only breakfast and was the same for all 5 days and below average. Napkins were literally dirty with stains. The coffee shop is good though in terms of fast service and friendly staff. If you are looking for good coffee, then forget it. It's all the instant coffee. The room is good size, all amenities are there except slippers. No coffee or tea making in room. Electrical sockets are serious hazard. They are all broken and dangerous. Bed is comfortable though. Free wifi is available everywhere in hotel. Towels have an extremely strong smell of chlorine. I would stay somewhere else if I visit again.",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Faisal A,"I was just at this hotel for my first overseas trip ever and the Pearl Continental Hotel, Rawalpindi made it a pleasant and comfortable experience. I was pretty nervous about what to expect when overseas in terms of accommodations and food etc. and this hotel was an oasis of comfort and security for me. The staff generally spoke good English at the front desk and concierge station and the breakfast buffet was huge and had both familiar and native foods to choose from with variety each day. The rooms were lovely and spacious with very modern decor, A safe was provided as well as bathrobes, slippers, a computer station/desk area, 2 sitting chairs and a nice LED TV.

Tom D,"I am a US citizen here on a contract and am staying at the Pearl. We as US citizens expect a lot when a hotel is listed as a 5 star. While the Pearl is comfortable, the restaurants are very good, power interruption is minimal there  is a lacking of courtesy. Example, I brought my laundry to the front desk to drop off and was told to take it back up to the six floor and leave outside the door. My response, Excuse me? You want me to go back upstairs and leave it outside the door?  He said yes, I ask for a manager and he did take it and send it out. This is not a response from a 5 Star. I have been here for five days and yet to have a hot shower.  I have complained 3 times and nothing has changed. I have tried at 8am, noon and 5 pm all the same, Luke warm at best. Nothing worse…",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

I only ate one night in the hotel buffet bbq which was good. Overall I have no complaints for my 3 night stay.",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
wasapninworld,"Stayed here for a day. The breakfast was not continental at all. Most of the breakfast geared towards towards the local market but it would have been great to have other options. Lunch was very simple and not a lot of choice which was a shame. I had always heard so much about PC so this experience was a let down. The rooms were very small and dark. The free internet just would not work, even after calling IT help. The decor had a lot of wear and tear and would need upgrading. The lobby area was nice.

Premysl,"While the hotel claims to be a 5-star posh, I wouldn't give it more than 3 stars.   The location is among military HQ areas and sporting grounds, right at a very noisy Peshawar/Mall Road, walking distance from Saddar local shopping district. Although warned not to walk around alone, being of obviously European look, we had no safety problems, the people were quite friendly and Saddar shops significantly cheaper than in other parts of the Islamabad/Rawalpindi twin-town. Safety measures at the hotel are quite strict, although I doubt that it is effective enough.  Hotel facilities are okay, rooms are clean but agey and in need of some restoration.

Seemed like i was staying in a 3 star hotel located on Mall road. Beds were highly uncomfortable with thin pillows. Complimentary fruit platter contained an apple, a peach and an orange along with 3 biscuits that were old and soggy. Asked for newspaper which was never received.

pilgrim_gsa,This is quite well kept hotel and seems almost like cantonment itself .There are security people all around giving a sense of unease with so many people in official and unofficial dress. Food is excellent  rooms  well kept though bathrooms need a bit of attention and updation . Wifi worked quite fast and is a welcome service .Front office quite efficient .,5,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
Bernice B,"Perhaps I have been spoilt and my expectations are too high, but all I was expecting was a ""Holiday Inn"" standard hotel.  This hotel falls short in my opinion. It's desperate for a refurbishment, everything is old and shabby, as a result it feels unclean.  The aircon is noisy and hardly even cools, I would hate to stay there in summer, it would be unbearable. I requested a non smoking room, when first taken to the room, it absolutely reeked of smoke, the staff were gracious and pleasant and changed the room immediately.  The next one was ok, from the non smoking perspective, but the pillows / bedding had a very strange smell and the linen did not feel clean and crisp. We noticed that in many ""non smoking rooms"" the guests were smoking.  The hotel management should apply a fining…",2,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Headdoc2000,"The Marco Polo is one of the restaurants at the Pearl Continental Hotel, Rawalpindi. We wanted to go to the Chinese Restaurant there for dinner, but having no reservations we would have to wait about 45 to 60 minutes for a table so went to Marco Polo instead.  You (and we) should be forgiven for thinking it was an Italian Restaurant. It is not! It had a buffet service of rather bland lackluster fare that can be expected in such places. We were more interested in the conversation so we enjoyed our time without any help from the food service.  My verdict - over priced for the average food and ambience!!",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
Muji,A great place to stay in Rawalpindi  Clean rooms Great service  The hotel is old and located in mid town  The food options are great  Probably the best option in Rawalpindi   Its minutes away from the airport by car  ,4,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi
Hasmet T,"I stayed overnight in this hotel and it was an average hotel in Pakistan standarts,  The advantage of the hotel is its close proximity to the airport.  The personnel was trying to be friendly but they were not trained well enough and it showed.  The rooms in the hotel were not clean enough for a 5 star hotel and there were loud generator noise in the hotel when we experienced electricity cut out 5 times during the night and 3 times in the morning.  Breakfast was really bed, you can hardly find something to eat except omlette bar.  And the real nuisance was the check out at hte reception.  Check out at the reception was really terrible when it gets crowded, because they allocated only one station for the check out and there were a few people checking out at the same moment as I…",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

Faisal S,"Historic heritage hotel. Nice grounds , lounge, large pool area. Spacious and a nice retreat away from the immediate bustle of Rawalpindi. VERY large airy and comfortable bedrooms, large beds, tall ceilings, with individual integral adjoining lounges ( lounge about 16 foot by 10) , nicely air conditioned. Very good dining with a pagoda ( where dancer performs in the evening). Friendly and welcoming. Good service. 6 of us aged 5 to mid 60s arrived by about 7 am morning. Clearly this was well ahead of check out time for other guests. We were made very welcome and were immediately given free two very large suites to settle in before transferring to our booked suites. To us this added to the period charm.",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Rawalpindi

The Hotel staff really goes out of their way to make you feel special and ensure that your holiday is going well. We were fortunate to stay in a Suite with all the modern technology and the rooms are so well designed, maximizing the superb views. The beds are so comfortable it is sometimes a chore to get up in the morning!

renna-zoristo,"I am a very strict grader when it comes to surveys. To rate a hotel a ""5"" in any one category is extremely rare for me. This hotel received a 5 in every category. Simply put: unheard of and unexpected. Every single element of this hotel was exceptional. Truly First Class all the way. Friendliness of staff, high quality of accommodations, and well thought out necessities for the business traveler. 24 hour spa and business center work around your schedule not theirs. This was helpful given my jet lag as my body clock was on a different time zone. Personal trainer in the gym and even 24 hour personal butler service. Couldn't ask for more.

In a country like Pakistan, you cannot wait for 3 hours!! I called the hotel management for inquiry and astonishingly nobody turned up. I went to the reception myself and was given a blunt statement that the management is busy in fixing the AC problem. Really??? Are they out of mechanics and engineers??

The rooms were tastefully done but there was evidence of some wear and tear as well as dirt, especially in the bathroom. The curtains too need a good wash. Why do some people doubt this hotel's 5 star status, especially if you have been to other 5 star properties particularly in Southeast Asia? 1. The rooms are small 2. Beds are way too worn and seem to be of poor quality 3. Unimpressive lobby (perhaps it is impressive by local standards?) 4.

Najam Saqib,I stayed at PC Rawalpindi on 1st November along with my family. I must say it’s was a nightmare staying at this PC franchise. I had to change my room several times due to the broken beds and unhygienic rooms. They were insects walking in the rooms. After changing the room about three times I was advised by the front desk officer Sajid that I won’t be able to change the room and should make peace with what is being offered. If the kids were not sleepy and exhausted because of the long journey I swear I would have moved place in the middle of the night. The next morning I took up my complaint with the manager and met Mr.Ifthikar who was the executive floor manager and to my surprise he was the most illetrate person extremely unprofessional.

AJ1,"PC Rawalpindi has never been my favourite. Had to stay here as the meeting was in place few minutes away. Rooms are tired and bathrooms are unhygienic by International standards (pictures attached as to how unhygienic the bath tubs and tissue holders are).  I needed a blanket and kept ringing guest relations but no answer. Probably guests are not there priority. So I rang the front desk and eventually when it arrived, there was a big stain on it. All this is happening when you need extra care in this COVID era. When TV was switched on, it said no signal! Wasn’t bothered to ask for someone at 10 pm fixing it.

Everything ready for the quest in the hotel - the restaurants - with good local and European food. Managers ready to help in any situation. Everything at a normal European level!

hamids985,"I stayed there for about a month. Everyone, specially the front desk staff were extremely helpful, professional and friendly. The rooms were spacious very clean and the food from Loafology was excellent. Located in the center of Islamabad. All it needs is a gym and a pool. Will definitely stay there again. Thank you for the warm hospitality. ",5,The 108 Hotel

Mir Salman Ali,"Amazing hotel with amazing people specially Mahrukh at the reception. I think 108 hotel is the best boutique hotel of Islamabad , expensive but newness comes with price. LOAFOLOGY serves amazing sandwiches and coffee. Gym spa and pool coming soon",5,The 108 Hotel
Mátyás J,"This hotel is a true gem in the heart of Islamabad. The rooms are spacious, quiet and equipped with high-quality furniture. The bed and pillows are extremely comfortable and the AC ensures you get a good night of rest, while the reliable and fast wifi allows you to work. The food at Loafology and Dragon City are delicious.   However, what makes this hotel special is its staff, who go above and beyond to ensure you have a good stay. They help you coordinate your arrival and attend to your needs (e.g. I had to check out very early and they kindly arranged breakfast to go without a request - they even helped me in calling the taxi driver and guiding him to the hotel) Thank you to Faheem and the rest of the 108 team for all the help!",5,The 108 Hotel
Safia A,"I found This gem while visiting Loafology and ended up staying for 5 days. Has a very modern vibe think, Miami or south beach. Very polite & accommodating staff.

shehryarafzal,"Excellent stay. Very modern hotel. Extremely hospitable staff. Staff went out of their way to fix and recharge my car's battery when it would not charge, all on their own without letting me move an inch to address the problem. Breakfast at Loafology was superb. In-room dining/room service was also from Loafology, which was excellent. Overall - extremely satisfied with stay and would definitely recommend as one of the topmost places to stay at in Islamabad. If you are a young couple or even a family, forget the Marriott or Serena Islamabad - the 108 should definitely be your next Islamabad stay. You will not be disappointed in any way at all!  ^Speaking as an unbiased, first-time booker!",5,The 108 Hotel
Randhir,"I spent one night, the room was fantastic and the reception staff were extremely courteous and helpful. I have stayed at a few places in Pakistan and this was the one that really hit the mark for me in terms of quality and value for money. In future visits to Pakistan I will not hesitate to book a room at the 108 Hotel. My one suggestion to the management would be to provide complimentary coffee/tea in the room.",5,The 108 Hotel
Osman Babar,A very clean and professional hotel. Rooms are modern. The location has to be the most ideal and best in all of Islamabad. Their restaurant is one of the most famous spots for breakfast across the city. Reception staff is professional and friendly.

Saeed_Motiwala,"The 108 Hotel is a hidden gem, in central Islamabad. Small hotel, but lovely rooms and friendly service. It punches well above its weight. Worth a stay.  One small point of improvement - better extra beds. The mattress provided, rather than rollaway bed, in the case of child travelling with you, is uncomfortable, and not in keeping with the level of comfort and design of the room, or the rest of the hotel.",4,The 108 Hotel
hassanriaz2022,Very clean and tidy. Bathroom and linens were clean and well washed with hot water.Room was spacious and  the decor of the hotel is very relaxing.

NKTM,We all enjoyed our stay at The 108. Some of the things we appreciated were:  - Prayer mat in the room - Communal kitchen (very handy with small children) - The tasty breakfast can be served in your room for a small fee - Loafology prepared allergen free parathas for our 4 year old  - The pillows are cloud-like  - Good service with well trained staff  The only improvement suggestion I have are: - Making a proper extra bed available rather than just a mattress on the floor (although the mattress was perfectly fine for our children) - Having the qibla direction in the room,5,The 108 Hotel
DrAsim1985,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in in not just Islamabad, bit in Pakistan. Very clean. Friend;y Staff. Amazing breakfast. Fast internet. Convenient location. 8 minute drive from Faisal Masjid, 1 minute drive from Centaurus mall. Breakfast at Loafology was spot on. ",5,The 108 Hotel

irfanaqureshi,Its a nice hotel to stay for a short period. Staff was very responsive and supportive. Following are some of the actions that would further improve the guest experience. 1) Buffet Breakfast. 2) Valet Parking. 3) Optimize the prices of In room dining (they are very high at this point in time) 4) please replace the Glass wall between washroom and room with a concrete wall,4,The 108 Hotel
nanometre,"Comfortable room - stylish design.  Open storage (can't hide things away as no cupboards) but lots of it.  Good shower/bathroom facilities, comfy bed, delicious welcome treats.  Breakfast was delicious - from the excellent Loafology cafe downstairs - however although the advertised opening time was 0630 in real life that's just the time they started setting up.  It's a la carte rather than buffet - so not the best breakfast-wise for those with an early start.  Recommend getting breakfast delivered to your room instead - beautifully presented and exactly at the requested time.  Thanks Ahmad and team for looking after guests so well, and resolving any issues swiftly.",5,The 108 Hotel

Climber31530528492,"I have stayed at 'The 108 Hotel' twice now and both times I found the Hotel stay to be very comfortable. Located in the Blue Area at Jinnah Avenue, it is located ideally for a Islamabad visit as every market or site worth visiting is within 10 - 15 minutes of the hotel. The rooms are new and their design contemporary. Also the staff and management is very courteous and accommodating. The last but not the least, the complementory breakfast is given in Loafology (located on the ground floor of the same building) and you can also order in room service from Loafology and their Asian restaurant 'Sesame and Soy'. The only thing I would want them to improve is that it is rather too pricey, considering they are a Boutique Hotel.  ",5,The 108 Hotel

Mustafa B,"Excellent hotel with probably the best and the most co-operative staff, we reached a bit early than their check in time, they didn't let us check in early but gave us complimentary cupcakes to make up for it, they went out of the way to accommodate me by letting me check out later than their late check out time. Their breakfast at Loafology was also a great addition. Plus the location is also very good with everything just being 10 mins drive away.

Nargis Rafique,I stayed here for 2 nights and expected atleast a comfortable stay. I was wrong. The AC doesn't cool enough and the blankets are so thick that they make you sweat. I honestly couldn't sleep the whole first night. The service was satisfying and the food was above average. I don't think i'll stay in this hotel again.,2,Islamabad Regalia Hotel
assim h,We stayed here for 4 nights. The room we got had a view towards the front side which was nice. We also checked the backside which was less/not pleasant. The AC was not efficient at cooling the room quickly but then we had to have it at the lowest temperature before going to bed so that we could easily sleep. The problem then was that we would freeze in the middle of the night. We did use their thick blankets and that just made us sweat. The hotel can definitely buy better blankets. The people working there are very nice and helpful.,2,Islamabad Regalia Hotel

I haven't even managed to close the car's door that the very kind doorman has already taken my luggage to reception. Then, magic happens: Mr. Nadar Ghori masters the ability to make people feel ""like home"", even when so far away like my case (I am from Argentina).

Room # 116   Sharing some points here, which I wanted to appreciate :   • First Mr.Faizan welcomed me with one big bouquet (such a warm welcome)   • As a welcome or complimentary drink they asked me for tea or juice.   • When I went for breakfast, there was a female employee who greeted me with such a cute smile and good to know that she was newly hired, She was so potentially interested in her work which was up to the mark.  (My room key wasn’t working so she went to the reception and got my key charged.

From day one we were treated as family and all staff accommodated our needs at very short notice. Our function was thoroughly planned and exceeded expectations. The standard of service and hospitality remains outstanding and there really is no other place to stay in Islamabad. It is well located with Centaurus being 15 mins away and Monal Islamabad being 40 mins away. Lots of local attractions to visit nearby so travel time is minimised. The breakfast buffet set us up for the day and we regularly treated ourselves to the great room service menu. Burgers at 2am were devine! Great facilities, great hospitality and great service.

fareeda2013,"I stayed with my family at the Regalia Hotel as our flight was from Islamabad airport. Upon arrival I had my doubts. I had no previously knowledge of this hotel as it was not one of the most well known chains that I usually stay at. Being a frequent traveller, I am very reluctant to stay somewhere that I have never heard of and I tend to veer toward a more safer option but I was unbelievably surprised at the level of the hotel.   Firstly, as we entered the hotel, we were greeted by a gentleman at reception by the name of Nadir. His warm smile, soft manner and his communication skills were amazing. His passion for his job and professionalism shone through and he made our check in as well as our stay as a whole, one to remember.

Desi food lovers can have a treat with their halwa puri and nihari etc and those who are calorie conscious can have multiple healthy choices to choose from .

Our stay throughout the PC was great. The staff in all its operations (room service, dining services, queries on nearby attractions etc) was throughout extremely accommodating, professional, and courteous. There was not one instance where the staff was 'bad-tameez' or indifferent.   The rooms we had (deluxe suites and other kinds of suites) were spacious. Due to the area being so cold, their heating system within rooms, while solid, did leave some areas of the rooms that were a bit chilly (e.g., underneath desks). So, perhaps that's something they can work on.   What's fantastic is that…",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Malam Jabba

mani Y,"    It is an interesting place with vast lands, green spaces and a fair amount of activities.  Food is terrific and the prices are reasonable.   The problem however is not with the premises as such but with the Staff.  Being a half glass full person I shall write about some brilliant people at the resort; Talha at the reception is a wonderful and kind concierge. Almost all Waiters, helpers, cleaning staff are well mannered and up to the task.   If you need anything dial the Reception not HOUSEKEEPING, they will ignore you.  The Housekeeping is horrendous, asked for duvet it never came, towels were in laundry and there was not a single dry one for the first 6 hours of our stay.   But the rudest part of the entire stay was a man showing up at our door 15mins before we were due to checkout. It felt like your time is over you need to leave, I am not sure if they do that to everyone or they made an exception for us. In any hospitality industry that would be considered an unforgivable mistake. I hope they sort that out.   Apparently that particular gentleman who knocked on our door was also sent by housekeeping.   The housekeeping really need to get it's house in order  We checked out at 11.55, five minutes before our scheduled leave.   …",4,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

irfanahmad2016,"This was my first ever visit to the Resort. There are many areas which require improvements. First of all reception team is not efficient and takes too much to process any thing. They even charged me less amount (which i paid later after reaching home on their request) then i was supposed to pay at checkout. For any small request if a call is made to reception, either response time is so slow or nothing happens at all. Maintenance activity needs to be performed in washroom of room number 24 where i stayed as there was leakage of water from basin! This shows that proper maintenance has not been done since long. Overall its reasonable place but needs to improve a lot.",3,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

Saad S,This resort is a nice place to visit but only weekends. It has nothing of a 5 star and all facilities are barely of a 3 star resort except the accommodation. Which is nicely located on a hill top. Rooms r nice n clean.  They have day n night activities but night  activities timing r absurd. For example they have water slide open from 2 AM to 4 AM and some other.  The reason that this place is on the top of the ranking is because it is a fun place. 3 star resort + plus 2 stars of yr own group can make it a 5 star experience.,3,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

On second day two of my brothers who were recently married were asked to move to different rooms as some 'VIP member guests' wanted to stay in those rooms, I flatly refused and called Booking.com, who called back the resort and gave them a dressing home and we kept our room.

Nabiel A,"We stayed for 2 days early april and the DWL team made us feel at home right from the word go. The chalet# 1 was splendid with beautiful scenery from the balcony. Facilities were v good and specially water in the slides/lagoon was clean!! But the bowling area desperately needs repairs. Late night walk is something every karachiite can only dream of here but it's absolutely safe at DWL. The only shortcoming was food quality, whether the restaurants or room service... Tea wasn't served hot.. Lastly, major credit goes to the staff for making us extremely comfortable. Special thanks to Miss AYESHA KANWAL for all the support throughout, even after our trip when she got left overs recovered from our room and handed them over to us at DWL Head office.. Thank you Dreamworld!",4,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

Room service was very professional and courteous. They are charging very less for the deals. The ambience and fun activities is what gives this place an edge over others as you have a long list of activities to choose from for kids and adults alike be it water based or dry. We live in Karachi but we felt like we had taken a vacation in another city altogether. I was truly impressed to see this quality and maintenance.

Mansoor_Raja,"This resort is NOT properly managed. It is NOT customer-friendly. I will not comeback in this resort again. The problem is this resort is that management NEVER takes into account the comfort and convenience of its customers. You have to make a lot of follow-ups before they will act on your complaints. It seems profit is their only motivation without taking into account the comfort of their guests. I will never stay in this resort ever again!!!!  There rooms are quite nicely decorated. But this is not why visited the place with kids. They claim to have more than 160 facilities. This place started in 1996 and now 90% of the facilities are very old and out dated. The only good part is the water facilities, pool, slides etc. On website they advertise for Paddle Boat,Rowing boat,…",2,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

Staff could be a bit more courteous rather than acting as policemen. Saw a couple of kids going for rides which clearly were not meant for their age, but the attendants did not seem to bother.  This was a cause of concern as it could cause a fatal accident. The food was great but lacked variety.",3,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

Sunny,"I had my stay for 2 days at Resort. I usually come at this place with my family. I really love the taste of their cuisines, specially there Breakfast at Bistro. But this time it was all compromised. No taste in any food at all. Only Dhaba had a great taste. Another awkward moment is, the resort management don't  even know on how to accommodate to the members. They book the whole resort while you have to go here and there on asking about where is the food available??? Atleast they should value to their members who spend monthly maintainance and buy expensive memberships.  Stay is very good, service is very good. The only thing which is getting worse by time, they are overloading the resort and not giving any attention to their members. Food quality has been greatly compromised.

The resort itself is well maintained except golf course which is not up to the mark although good for beginners only. Currently 9 hole is in operational for which desperate improvement is needed in all aspects tees, fairways , bunkers and greens.There is no night golf facility as mentioned on many advertisements.

Breakfast was great but very limited dishes !

wasiq51,"Stayed here because it looked ok on travelocity.  Found the room to be dirty (particularly the bathroom).  Bathroom seat toilet seat was broken and shifted widely when used.  Room was full of mosquitos.  Hotel is in a remote location inside an amusement park/golf resort.  The rooms fill up at night with seedy people looking for private rooms to cram into for all night drinking and smoking binges.  Getting to the rooms requires an automobile.  Overall, this place needs to be cleaned up, repair toilets, wipe down the bathrooms, and get rid of the mosquitoes before your guests get malaria or dengue fever.",1,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

We visited Dream World during the winter season so couldnt enjoy their water rides and pools, however,  there are several other activities such as indoor play areas, bowling, archery, go cart, desert safari etc that'll easily keep you busy. The quality of food is also amazing, we tried their Bistro for breakfast and had dinner at their BBQ restaurant which serves delicious BBQ food.

Every time we had few issues but we thought it could just lack of communication between the departments but this time the experience we had was beyond disappointment. After consulting on phone with the representatives in Hyderabad namely Madeeha, Baber and Nida we finalised the plan. However when we reached the Resort on 08/09/2017 with 201 people we were treated as if we were some outcaste people. I strongly condemn the way my team was treated after charging us hefty amount of Rs 1350.00 per person.

Yankeefan1980,We have traveled to many resorts around North America and having developed certain expectations I can honestly say Dreamworld is on par with any 3 or 4 star international resort.  The highlights are outstanding customer service and terrific food.  The facilities are very well maintained and the rooms are high quality.  If anything could improve it may be that most activities are not operating on schedule and guests are not permitted to use some of the facilities during daytime hours. Other than that for about  $100/ night this place was a steal.  ,5,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

Syed H,I went to check out the golf course while visiting family in Karachi. My cousins asked me twice about taking me there. The place is located outside the city. One has to travel on the highway which is known to be shady. The resort complex is really off the beaten path and surrounded by half built houses. We had called ahead but were given a hard time by the armed guards at the gate. if you are coming for golf; don't. The course is a mess. Dry and dusty.  The resort was kind of empty when I went. There were a lot of families. It was December and cold by Karachi standards. It was winter but warm like July in the States. The bungalow style rooms looked nice from outside. I would not recommend this place to foreigners because it is located in an isolated area. My cousins had been…,2,"Dreamworld Resort, Hotel & Golf Course"

The rooms are nice and cosy, with all that one would expect from a hotel of decent standard. I had extra decorations done, and they were done well.  As lodgers, we got access to the many activities available at the resort. These range from horse riding to water slides.  Room service is available 24hrs, and food can be delivered in the room as well.  The only issue I found was that the WiFi was a bit slow and that the warm water takes a long time to come into the taps.   All in all, it's a great place to visit for people of all ages.

It was totally not worth Rs 3000 Per person. It is a place worth Rs 500 per person. Extremely dirty, not at all maintained, the condition was poorer and worse than I visited 10 years a go, hence showing no maintenance despite of charging so much. Ugly bathrooms, ugly pools, ugly slides. The gentry made us feel sick, all villagers having no manners and extremely uncivilized gentry. In short, this place might be worth visiting but for only Rs 500 per person whole day, not at all worth more than that. I wish we would have stayed home that day, regretting my decision.

There are no safety or security concerns (which was my primary concern) but once I was there inside the resort I felt like being in heaven, lol.

Reserve for at least a week.  Rooms have good views. The best part is waking up and having good feel of the serenity and nature around yourself. There are numerous activities you can do but don't over tire yourself. Go with the flow and know your limits. The staff is very accommodating and friendly.   But don't fall into the traps of reception staff as they don't jitter in bluffing and giving you wrong advice. Better do your research (google) and look up for rates and other charges before going.

Dining choices are good. Though there has not been any addition to the 2 main dining choices (Pakistani and Chinese) in past few years. Addition of another choice of food (maybe Italian, continental) would be a value add.  Very scenic views.

However, I & my husband we had a buffet lunch that was a disaster. Less variety, very high price, very few & tasteless menu items for a 5* hotel buffet.

For discounted rates and longer stay ask for PRIVILEGE CARD from them. This will reduce the cost of meals in all restaurants to 50 %. Also, the room rents will be almost 30-40 % lesser for off seasons. Parking is always good there. Walking track is also awesome.

There is enough to entertain the whole family. Breakfast was fantastic and very tasty with traditional and continental options. The bed was comfy and the shower etc all worked well.   Cons  The only down side was that we had a bedroom with an adjoining door and the guest on the other side was smoking. The smoke did drift into our room. The other room we booked had a noisy neighbour that insisted on watching TV v loudly. However once we notified reception they resolved this. We also asked to borrow and iron which wasn't that good but not a massive issue. ,5,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

The Hotel claims to be a five star accommodation; however seriously lacks certain prerequisites for the same. I booked a valley view room, which hardly had some view except that of the Tennis Court and few tree tops. Though, the staff was extremely courteous and welcoming; they cannot make out for the absence of luxuries at the Hotel. Let me give few negatives first:-  1.  The air conditioners were not working.

The staff at the Terrace Cafe were also very helpful and lit the fireplace for us whenever we went. What we did not understand is why the Nadia Coffee Shop only had a buffet every night  and Tai-Pan the Chinese restaurant was only a la carte?  We were just two people so it is not practical to go for a Chinese meal where one orders a number of dishes and shares.  If there must be a buffet it should be at Tai-Pan and not at Nadia.

The booking staff at the reception, specifically Mr. Arsalan is highly unprofessional, rude and irresponsible. We requested for two nights booking of their executive room but we were told that category was fully booked. Mr. Arsalan then suggested we should go for a deluxe room instead as it was available for 2 nights. He then asked the bell boy to show us the room before making the final booking.

LBrick7,"Beautiful setting and surroundings. That is the only good thing about this decadent hotel that requires investment and refurbishment. Facilities are definitely not 5 stars but 1 star. Food is beyond bad: poor quality ingredient and food at a very high price. Generally speaking the buffet and the food in the only two restaurants is awful with waiting times of around 45 minutes. Staff has the right attitude and training but the facilities are totally neglected. The gym is old, darl, dirty with no single locker working in the male dressing rooms and a very claustrophobic women's gym facilities. Everything is old and although the rooms are refurbished the lighting is beyond bizarre with either too much light or very dark.

As a 5- star hotel, I expected my meals to be good in taste and presentation. I ordered Chicken steak which came with only two options. Mushroom and spicy/red sauce. I chose mushroom sauce and to be very precise, steaks had little to no spices in it, the mushroom sauce tasted Awful and chicken was not even marinated as they had no taste in the inside or even outside. The shakes had two options; Fresh and Ice cream. I ordered mango ice cream and the one that came was a normal mango Milkshake with no ice cream.

Harvey B,"So we booked a deluxe room. Turns out it's pretty much the same as a standard room but they charge you extra for it. We were promised a pool and mountain view and a balcony. We were given a room on the ground floor with no view to speak of. There is a seating area outside the room but I'm pretty sure you can't call it a balcony if it's on the floor? We asked for a change and they offered us a twin room. We refused.  There's no kettle in the room. When we asked for one, we're told that's only in the executive rooms... I'm pretty sure a kettle should be accommodated in a reasonably expensive hotel that calls itself 5 star! The food in the terrace cafe was ok but expensive for what it is.

Murtaza S,This place badly needs renovation. And has probably not been maintained or redone since the building was made.  So let's start from the beginning.  Just before pc bhurban gate their is a Rs. 200 toll tax which means when ever you go out and come back to your hotel you pay this rs 200. ($20) other hotels in the near abouts are free from this.  Then just before entering the hotel it's like crossing the border. Even airport is easy. They should install car scanners if they are so scarred.  They treat you like rubbish you have to get off the car to get things scanned.  This is usually done as many times as you go in and out of the hotel boundary.  So we checked in to room #338 on January 7th. And checked out on 9th.  After checking in we had to wait for our welcome drink and fruit…,3,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Its the service & efficiency of the staff and genuine care for the guest which makes any hotel a true 5 star hotel( after all in hotels there are no customers there are GUESTS).  The root of the problem is that there are no competitors for PC hotels in Pakistan so they have made themselve kings of hospitality. This PC Burban would have run out of business with its current level of service if there has been any good competitor. These people know that there,s no other place to go so they have made PC only a money making machine. would recommend the hotel for short stays",2,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Though the service level at the restaurants are not at par specially in the summer periods if there is more public rush at the hotel which is an area of improvement for hotel.

Rasika G,On our way to Murree looked for a place to have lunch. Hotel Ambiance was sounds good. Tired with security check ups. Buffet restaurant had closed sharp at 3.00pm & was to order from Ala cart restaurant. Had to wait for a table & the service was too slow. The food was average compare to 5S menu .Gardening & Landscaping was amazing & can have a jungle track if you feel bored.,3,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Zafar U,"We had two meetings in the hotels in July and Aug 2017. As it was very peak season at PC Bhurban, yet we had received all the services as per satisfaction. The banquet team especially Mr. Rahmaullah was very cooperative in all respects. There were slight issues with the room cleanings and service but considering the full occupancy, those are compoundable. We had a wonderful time at PC Bhurban during our two meetings.",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Rooms are comfortable and relaxing with all facilities available, including ironing and electric kettle. Breakfast was the best with wide variety of items. The environment inside the hotel is also very relaxing and very modern. The area around the hotel is perfect for walking and view around the hotel is breathtaking. Other available facilities like gym etc. were also excellent and every thing was well defined and easily accessible. Famous Mall Road at Murree is also very near.",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
BKC2003,"When I think of High Tea, I picture some finger food and a cup of tea. This is an inaccurate discription of what you will receive at the Pearl Continental.  High Tea at this hotel means you have multiple choices of main dishes, salads and desserts. Think of it like a big buffet of quality food.  Besides eating, the grounds of the hotel are spacious, beautiful, and worth walking around.",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
Anwer K,"It's really money's worth. The amenities and professionalism of staff is outstanding. Variety of food is outstanding. It's good for families.

Kausar Wali,"Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban is the only place to stay in this area if you want to enjoy your hotel facilities because no other hotels in the area provides all facilities in one place. If you compare with other 4 or 5 stars Hotels you place it below average but always compare with availabilities of the area. Our room view is excellent towards swimming pool. I enjoyed walk on path during snow falling. Only two things bother me, one is wash room not of this hotel standard and other is floor is noisy, don't know why? Otherwise We enjoyed our trip very much without leaving Hotel most of time during stay. Food is nice. Service is good. Always book earlier for your trip because in both seasons it remains fully booked.",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
Basit Iqbal,"Went to the hotel for a day trip. The hotel has way too many charges and worst of all the entry charges cannot be used at a A La Carte restaurant! Forced to go for high tea at Nadia Coffee shop, it was the worst possible tea, with cold and tasteless BBQ and haleem. Most sweets were also not up to the mark. Definitely not value for money.

salman r,It was a great experience. In the morning I was doing my routine work in office then my friend call me and said to go Murree. We reached there 1pm easily.

Good place for family and friends. I enjoyed a lot.,4,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
Ahsen G,"Ok i must mention that going to the hotel for past 10 years on Cardiology conferences and other occasions i was not a fan of this place. As most of u know why, but i just went today to visit a friend and have tea on the terrace. A sharply dressed man greeted me and impressive display of manners. A young petite manager was also keeping an eye on the lobby preceedings. I was pleasantly surprised as am usually greeted with staff who look like are always tired. I jokingly asked the man if new management is here and he with a pleasant smile said yes. He was the new Manager a mister Ansar. Iam finally glad the hotel has introduced this level of new employees. I guess they finally understood life is about taste, not tasks. Wish you all well.",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Sajjad R,I happen to stay at this hotel for 1 night for attending a meeting with other fellow doctors. My experience was pathetic about the hotel. The hotel people are not courteous and the rooms need a lot a lot of repair. Hotel Management just seems to be minting money and have no interest in improving guest comfort or room service. There was no facility for coffee or tea making facility and when asked they said we don't have this facility and you have to buy from room service. For a 4 star this is not appropriate in my opinion. Food quality was bad to average. Everything is over priced. Seems if you go for fresh air they might even charge you for this. The only advantage is location and there is no other hotel for its match. Would not recommend to anyone. ,2,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

All in all versus other hotels e.g. Serena, Avari and even other PCs, this one is well below average, has ill trained staff specially at entrance and check in (I would even venture a bit rude) and not friendly to families.

I guess other Guest house services will be certainly better then this so called high…,1,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
Talha,"The ambiance and environment provided on the resort is really calming and stress-busting. Preserving nature ideology keeps the organic essence of Bhurban. The renovated rooms provides all the luxury. The hospitality of the overall staff is really good.   The resort property have been renovated but have neglected a major aspect of the resort stay. The privacy is a major factor, while considering travelling and accommodation booking. The rooms are nicely furnished but all the noises can clearly be hearable within the room and even outside. During our stay in a connecting room, all the talks and noises were clearly hearable from the other room. The ones privacy should be at priority, which have been neglected in my opinion. I hope it will be shortly considered and managed property. ",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Umair Jafri,"We stayed at PC Bhurban for two nights. We are regular visitors of this hotel and every time we experienced very delighted stay. But for first time during this September, we observed horrible things. Complimentary fruits were not provided. In breakfast, boiled eggs were rotten. Though good services were provided by staff. But food quality matters a lot. In Buffet; Pulao, murgh laziz handi, mix vegetable and fruit trifle were tasteless. I am just shocked how standard of this hotel can be so poor. Don't want to visit it again. We pay a lot for getting good quality food, good services and comfortable accomodation facilities.

The old rooms and furniture was unprofessionally repaired. Dirty toilet and showering area never been cleaning. To check the cause of slow out flow of water I removed the cover and it seems never been cleaned. The hotel has several additional and extra charges like you have to pay each time you enter in hotel. I suggest choose new facilities because such big group like PC are rich and powerful. They do not care if you come or not. The workers are rude and disrespectful.,1,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Mian I,it is the best place in that mountain area of Pakistan. The scenice view and good combination of OLD & NEW in look is very much facinating. Sometime little bit crowded due to visitors for view only. They have entry ticket which can be adjusted in your expences during dinning or stay. If you visit only to view it's scenic view then the said entry ticket will not be adjusted. Room are nice and well equipped. Breakfast was awsome. Nice place to visit however little bit expensive.

The rooms have a marvelous view but are rather poorly furnished. The general cleanliness of the room is on the poor side.

The most worst part of the room was the was room. Almost ever thing in the toilet was so old rusted, broken, and smelling. I decided to go leave the hotel and go back, but they did not wanted us to leave. So i got another room but that was not so good either.

tsamon,Pearl Continental Bhurban may claim to be a five star hotel (it certainly has more security than the Presidents House) but it is NOT a five star hotel. The staff at the front desk is extremely unhelpful and even discourteous. The corridors reek of a nauseating stale odor reminiscent of PIA airplanes. The furniture is tacky. The bathroom fittings are rusting. There is no internet in the rooms. All PC Bhurban has to recommend itself is the picturesque setting. But then again there are dozens of guest houses and hotels in Murree and Nathiagali with equally beautiful setting but for a much better price and experience.,2,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
mansooree,"At $165 a night, we expected true five star service. Unfortunately, the PC Bhurban does not deliver that. We were there at what was the start of the off-season, and hence the pool was out of commission, as was the tennis court and business center. Also, only two restaurants were effectively in operation, with the buffet breakfasts and dinners extremely monotonous and forgettable. The Chinese was a better bet. Many services that one would expect as standard in a five star were either missing or available as an extra at an (often exhorbitant) charge.   The hotel seems geared towards day trippers, sales conferences and honeymooners who have never travelled before. Guest expectations appear to be low and standards have dropped to match.   The grounds too have seen better days but…",2,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

Possibly to drum up business, the management had filled the place with day-trippers for the week-end, clearly paying a fraction of the $150 I paid.  Tacky amusements were laid on for these trippers in the grounds, such as air-pistol stands for bursting balloons, the pool was filled with loud mouthed louts, there was shouting in the corridors throughout the night - genuinely awful.  The room I was assigned (541) was located by an exhaust fan from the kitchen, so that the stench of cooking (oddly smelling of barbecue sauce) was present 24 hrs a day, so that you could not open your balcony door without smelling this stench.

Two hours' drive from Islamabad up winding mountain roads - as you get higher, you can actually smell the pine forests - a lovely contrast to the busman's fart you get so used to in South Asian cities.  The views from the hotel are just mind-blowing. The gentle rolling Murree hills in the foreground, and the snow-capped mountains of Kashmir in the distance.  Murree was, famously, an old British hill station - and a lot of the Raj lives on today. Nowhere is this more true than the obvious love of gardens - the hotel gardens, which go on for acres, are pure EM Forster meets Gertrude Jekyll.

BB,"I was trying to make rooms reservations from the UK. I have stayed at Pearl Continental (PC) Bhurban many years ago and it was a nice stay. Was attempting to book several rooms for our group visit to Pakistan, on the PC website, which indicate rates in various currencies. I chose rooms, went through the process to make payment and each time it would say card authentication failed and rejected the payment. Tried with Amex, Mastercard and Visa payment. Each time the payment would fail. After nearly a week of emails back and forth and phone calls to the hotel and to my various credit cards, I managed to speak to someone at the hotel reception, on a whatsapp call and was told that Pearl Continental, did not accept international card payments!  I have to say that this was extremely disappointing and I found the website misleading and the failure to make a payment, confounding. The website gives the impression that it would be a straightforward process considering the website lists room prices in USD, GBP and PKR. I am further disappointed that this lack of clarity has resulted in delays in making an alternative booking and in the meantime, the room rates have skyrocketed! Will have to reconsider our stay at this hotel. I would suggest to the hotel, that PC please either start accepting advance payments to book rooms directly from customers outside of Pakistan on their website, or make it clear on the first page of your website, that you do not accept direct bookings from customers outside of Pakistan.…",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

When we ordered food we had to remind the waiter thrice to bring water. He brought 3 small bottles (for eight people) and one glass! When we asked for more glasses, he brought two more. Tables at the valley facing sides were vacant. When we again asked Sajeela, she said these are for couples only. We protested and the manager intervened but the lady receptionist was unmoved. In my visits to many restaurants in Pakistan and abroad I have never seen such an arrogant, rude and totally unprofessional staff. Then came food: stake was hard and difficult to cut, fish was smelly and panini and burgers were of the lowest quality too. It was a total waste of money.

I spent the whole day vomiting my guts out and feeling absolutely terrible. I did not expect this from such a ""prestigious"" hotel. I actually thought this would be the one place I could have safe and healthy food. Apparently not.  On top of that, their food doesn't even taste good! Totally not worth the price you pay…",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
Zubair,"So I have stayed across all PC hotels in Pakistan and the service for the Bhurban one is by far the worst.  Went to Nadia Cafe, our order was served incomplete. I specifically asked the waiter then to bring biscuits that are generally served when you order coffee/tea but he didn’t comply for some odd reason.  I think high frequency of customers at the hotel has made your staff ignorant of how to deal with customers. Please work on it. ",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
Umar I,"Today i have to face the most embarrassing situation at PC Bhurban. On March 27, 2018 my wife called to order tea at the reception  she was told that tea can only be sent if she will pay cash to the room service for the tea. Bringing this to your notice it was not asked on last two night and all previous bills including dinning were cleared on the same afternoon. She said OK we will pay cash please send tea and same happened. Then i received a call from Nadia restaurant at about 1045 to pay for buffet which we ate earlier as system is not accepting and i have to pay cash. So i went to the restaurant immediately and paid. If they would have asked me earlier payment was not the issue but the behavior was very much embarrassing for us. Please rectify this situation so this do not…",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban

But that's about it.  It's a shame to see such poor management of such a classic hotel. You would think they would have mastered the art of hospitality by now. I would have been happier to see an upgrade in the corridors and rooms to complete the 5 star setting. We took their biggest suite and it was okay but my god what a big mistake it was to be right above the night club. Every night was torturous and our baby kept crying due to the loud music!

The check-in and check-out were smooth, no waiting.   The room is completely refurbished with a complete makeover and new furniture. I can say this as I have been staying here, now and then, for the past two decades since the hotel opened its doors. Heating system working well. Lighting was adequate. ""Electronic switches"" for ""Do not Disturb"" and ""Make room"" are a nice addition. Electric kettle with tea. coffee and tea whitener was available. Nice room to stay.

Am H,It’s a shame.  What must have been once a fantastic property and service is now just remnants of mediocre hospitality and staff and management who do not really care. The only good staff were housekeeping team. You can see from the generic robotic responses to every negative review here that the management just do not care.   This is not a five star hotel by any stretch of the imagination. It is a three star or less equivalent. The reception staff do not know how to meet and greet and direct you at reception and do not make you feel comfortable. Everyone seems to be just looking to be tipped money. It’s a negative environment sadly.   No tea or coffee making facilities in the standard rooms only executive rooms. This is unheard of.

Booked this hotel upon recommendation from family and friends and the only thing I would say that is great here is the view. First night I was unable to sleep due to banging noises only to realise the following morning that there is a restaurant directly above the room. Requested to be moved but due to unavailability was unable to do so.... so I thought I’d give them another chance and was advised by staff at reception the noises would stop.

Being a blogger, I'm trying to convince international people to travel to Pakistan but places like this makes it quite difficult. It's hard to promote places like this.

Otherwise there is a list of how bad it is.  1 : their welcoming staff is not so welcoming , helping  or caring.

Imagine your rage when you are paying 30 k per night and you can't shower properly because it's drainage is blocked . 😣  3 : when at night we went for their buffet they made us wait 20 minutes after that just to clear our bill which was really frustrating.  4 : they have no interesting activities to do .  5 : they give you nothing in mini bar except for 1 to 2 mineral water or coke !

To start with its dirty, balconies haven't been cleaned in a while, bathrooms had small cockroaches in it. There was no tea service provided. Generally shabby and run down. There were too many people with too many kids. Children running in the corridors late at night (11.30) Noise from adjoining rooms. Breakfast service was haphazard and staff overworked. Everytime car enters the premises you have to pay a govt. toll tax, if car enters 4 times a day you have to pay the toll tax 4 times. Will not stay there again.

Except for the awesome location and the staff who are generally very helpful and courteous, I don't find many reasons to recommend this facility to my fellow readers.   The rooms are okay, but curtain malfunctions are almost universal, the crockery is often chipped and cracked and the general level of cleanliness is below standard.   We were here during Ramadan and the mess and mayhem that we witnessed at the time of Iftar and Sehri was unbelievable. The restaurants were so ridiculously overbooked that people were eating while standing with nowhere to sit. Food was not available in appropriate amounts. Refills were hard to come by.

PC Bhurban, is probably the best hotel in this area, its clean and has great views and lovely open spaces. You can tell that this once was a 5 star hotel in its pomp. It is in need of a little updating however and does look dated, probably not much more that a 3 or 4 star hotel.

Last December, we flew from Toronto to Islamabad  and drove to Bhurban with my in-laws to spend 2 days in the Murree Hills. They wanted me to see this side of Pakistan. The drive up to the hotel was spectacular and I was simply in awe.  We arrived at the hotel, where the lobby was fully decked out in Christmas decor as it was just around the corner and it looked beautiful! It wasn't tourist season at all, so there were no crowds. We were shown to our rooms which were cute and cosy , but my father in law, being how he is- asked for an upgrade. I was impressed with our first room, but I was speechless in our upgraded room!

BizTravelerPak,I stayed there as part of a business meeting. i was really disappointed with the rooms. the one i stayed in was not clean and service in the restaurants was terrible. The rooms were very old so were the bath rooms. Even the night light flickered on and off as if it was about to short circuit. It certainly is not worth visiting. i read this page before traveling and i read some one comment that the music is loud at night and one can hear it even inside one's room. I have to agree with that and i was laughing to myself when i was there & was trying to sleep at night but couldnt because the music kept me up in my room late at night.

The complimentary buffet breakfast was one of the best I have ever partaken. Every day there were different hot dishes to choose from.  It was satisfying that we did not need any lunch meals.

I usually go twice a year, Once in the summers and Once in Winters (off season) and its like a whole different place at both times.

This is a lovely hotel in a breathtaking location in the mountains about 90 minutes from Islamabad.  The views from rooms overlooking the valley, as well as most public areas of the hotel, are magnificent.  Service was impeccable, with everyone I encountered, from the front desk to the restaurants to the health club being polite, attentive and professional.  They have obviously been very well trained.

The staff is friendly and the service reasonable.    The not so good points:  The food options are limited and the food itself is adequate but nothing to write home about.

The quality of fittings and facilities in the rooms is simply great. There is a good selection of restaurants to choose from. The buffet breakfast was good.

The view as usual is great and the staff very helpful and cheerful. Had their buffet dinner, which although the food was of good quality, it lacked variety.  Considering the price tag, I expected them to add some more dishes. After dinner, we went for their open air musical night program.  The singing was good and lively and the band deserves a pat on the back for engaging with the crowd and entertaining them.

Otherwise, on whole it is a nice escape from crowded Murree without such amenities being offered by PC Bhurban.

I would rate PC Bhurban a fantastic hotel because of the following reason:  1) the location is a big big advantage which PC Bhurban is carrying either it's winter snowfall or summers you'll find the location up to the mark. 2) the rooms are quite well maintained having all nececassry 5 star hotel amenities and like all other pearl continental hotels 3) the food quality particularly in the recently opened Chinese resturant is good however you can't be so optimistic about Nadia when it comes to buffet lunch or dinner 4) other activities such as watching movie in theatre, tennis court or gaming zone is something which will keep you busy, in case if you have nothing to do :)   Would recommend…",5,Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban
Ali R,"Last weekend I booked two nights at Bhurban. Reached with my 2 kids and wife, we were given a room at the corner bottom floor without Any view though we were paying same rate.  Plus only one pair of elevators is available to cater to whole hotel. Carrying two strollers all the way from room to elevators was an exercise it self as the room was at the far end of hotel. Requested manager mr Imran to change room many times. Got the reply ""we are trying sir"" but no one called to inform us anything. Staff tried to ignore and hide from us when we approached reception. I felt ashamed of myself as if I was begging them to give me better service, aft paying them 5 star rates for a lousy 2 star hotel. Games for kids are out dated with worst conditions.

AAli_12,"PC Bhurban is no more an ideal five star hotel anymore ! It has become a fish market now, extremely crowded. Staff is very rude and not helpful. They have over 190 rooms and only 4 restaurants to serve food which are always full. On top of that they have walk in guests as well as parties all the time. The restaurant staff has so much attitude. Rooms are comfortable but non stop power turned off which is very irritating. Bathroom needs to be renovated and properly cleaned. Food is below average and not enough seating space at all. Parking is not enough and there is no valet parking at all. They have large number of security staff at the entrance who are only doing security checks instead they should provide valet services as parking is very limited.

I called the operator and someone came to fix the chain and then a guy came to just adjust the AC which then started working.

The day after my arrival, i had a room street side, i asked them is it was possible change side because the room was too noisy, they told me no problem, the day after nothing happened.

My travel plans were then changed so I had to cancel the room, which I did more than a week before my stay was scheduled to begin. The hotel still charged me for one night stay, even if I cancelled well within time as per my reservation. Has been in touch with the hotel several times since and they promise to return the one night charge to my card, but until now (10th March) nothing has happened. I will not consider this hotel for future trips to Karachi.",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi
bojantercon,"Once you get over the incredible (and I guess necessary) security at this hotel you actually enter an oasis of plush calmness.   The hotel is a little dated in style but has been maintained very well, which gives it a distinguished charm.  We had a corner room which was of a very good size. Larger than the regular rooms that we had seen earlier and subsequently asked to change for we wanted a king-size bed. The only odd thing was the bathroom. The toilet was  literally positioned right in the center of the bathroom. A most weird and yet very practical solution. It literally seemed like the toilet was an after thought.  Talking about the bathroom, we also had a glass sink. I was enamored with it for you could watch the water drain into the see-through sink while watching your…",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Rachel Wilson,"Attended an event, wedding and stayed in the hotel. Had dinner at the steak restaurant. Unpleasant and rude staff. Unwilling to help or listen.  Disallowed taking a selfie in the lobby. Rooms were dirty and old carpet. TV's don't work.  The ballroom and marque were pretty ordinary with very poor sound quality. There were mice running around in the corner.  Entering the hotel is as if you are entering a jail with prison like security. A pretty ordinary hotel which should not be classed as a 4 star but a 3 star at the most.  Compared to any UK or Asian hotel, it is a shame.",1,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

I arrived late in the evening, and 45 minutes after I settles, I received a call from guest relations asking if everything was ok - I liked the concept of welcoming the guests with a personal call, but it was 11pm - they should have been considerate, I was already in bed by then! The phone sound is too loud, it had to unplug it so I don't get another phone call in the middle of the night.   The hotel feels a little outdated, old furniture, but liked the glass counter in the bathroom. The bathroom faucets were going rusty, although worked just fine.

I stayed on the executive floor, the room was well appointed clean but here it all starts to fall apart again.  On the second day there was no laundry list left in the room and only after two telephone calls could I get the laundry picked up, no list but at least it got done, the bathroom was reasonable, they have obviously upgraded but there were traces of mould and the bathroom mat was sometimes there and sometimes not as was the second towel.

Then I was welcomed by a mouse crossing the red carpet before entering the hotel.  The check in was standard. I got a room on the executive floor. Poor architecture design. However the rooms had new furniture.  The bed was so soft. They could have done better by bringing firmer mattresses.   Dont expect any view.   What I did not like about the hotel was at the check out time they give a card, and ask please write about us on tripadvisor. Why should you force people to write, or ask them to write.  In my opinion the Movenpick opposite is a better place to stay.",2,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Nomad,"Stayed at PC Karachi for 2 weeks from 23 March 2014. The hotel is almost in the middle of Karachi approx half hour drive from Karachi Airport. It is located in a comparatively secured area and is within easy reach of notable attractions, restos etc. It is generally considered as a four star hotel, however in my opinion, after my recent stay, I can conclude that it is on the verge of becoming a three star hotel because of its falling quality of services. Following are the notable pros and cost   Pros: Very courteous staff, clean rooms, variety of sub-continent and chinese foods and good security  Cons: Very old furniture and carpet which giving a constant feel of outdated hotel, missing one or two toiletries almost on a daily basis, daily door access problem (once I had to wait…",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

They were always smiling and were very attentive to the guests. There was a gentleman named Shakir who used to take care of me and my family each morning for breakfast.

PC has the refined & soothing ambiance to de-stress you as soon as you enter it.  This is THE place to stay at while in Karachi.   I wrote a glowing review last year. Nothing much to add except to say that this Pearl has not lost any of its shine.  Service continues to be exemplary esp the amazing staff at breakfast buffet.

I would also like to say that in my career as an international investment banker and civil servant spanning about 50 years I have never come across a hotel executive as courteous and professional as Imran Khan, your restaurant manager. He is undoubtedly an asset for PC Hotel, Karachi, who should be treasured and nourished. It is clear that he not only has the big picture fully in view but also gives a lot of attention to detail. I have observed that in his interaction with subordinate staff he is a real, all inclusive, leader who inspires their trust and confidence, and motivates them to excel in performance.

Kim L,"I stayed at this hotel for two nights.  I found it very overpriced ($240 Cdn per night).  In case you did not know this, you cannot get a kettle in your room in Pakistan.  When I arrived in the room my safe was broken, my curtains did not close all the way, and the bathroom was the smallest hotel bathroom I'd ever seen.  The only positve thing I can say about the hotel is you can get a really good coffee in the Movenpick ice cream and coffee bar in the lounge (but if you want a morning coffee it is not open).  Also, the hotel staff really try hard and were very accomodating to me.  The airline lost my luggage and they were very helpful in getting it the next day.",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Security level is extremely high  Cons: I stayed there for 3 days in March 2012, though the hotel is one of the best in Karachi and I enjoyed staying there, however, with ever improving better customer services around the globe, PC Karachi really needs to bring in something new and fresh to its hotel. It doesn't look too old but it doesnt give a fresh feeling either. I feel that in the period of 5 years it might started giving a nostalgia feeling. It is already giving an impression of 4 star hotel. Furniture, curtains, lightings, all needs…",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

jzeb,"A tue gem very close to the business and leasure districts. The true beauty of the facade is comprpmised for the security. It is very secure with multi-layered check/scan points. Huge containers almost hide the entrance. The management has done a great job by operating with such security levels  The rooms are huge and are very clean. A very comfortable king bed, that we opted for.   The breakfast can spoil you for choices with live cooking as well.   Overall, highly recommended, and I will go back again.",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Raintree_Thailand,"Once successfully running the intimidating security gauntlet -- which surpasses most airport security in rigor, but is quite understandable considering security risks and the fact that the Pearl Continental's sister hotel in Peshawar was leveled by a car bomb a few years back -- guests enjoy what is a surprisingly pleasant and comfortable hotel.   Rooms are clean, beds and linens luxuriously soothing. Very good amenities; modern large flat screen TV with acceptable (but not great) selection of channels.  Clean rooms and sound maintenance.    Lobby and hallways are adorned with interesting art, antiques, and cultural items.    Overall, good service.  Can easily get around the problem of excessive intrusion of hotel staff into rooms, mentioned by some reviewers, by posting…",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi
MarkLondonMEt,"This has always been my favourite hotel in Karachi.  The facilities are great and the staff are friendly and helpful.  I either sty here or the Marriott, and I prefer here.   These days, the security is so intense that getting into the place takes ages and you have to go through lots of airport style security checks before you get near the front door.  The restaurants are OK; all hotels in Pakistan seem to have the same ones!   Lovely rooms (8th floor, executive) with free wifi and good TV",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Imagine, you are a tired of traveling and official meetings and want to be at your bed to step in to a deep heaven of sleeps and when it happens to you, in all of a sudden you woke up with a noise and found a hotel staff RIGHT AT YOUR HEAD and upon your query, as what he was doing here and smart answer !!!

Ean C,"I have stayed at the hotel several times now but will be asking for a change on the next trip, the constant pressure from the staff to tip for anything and everything has gone ver the top.  I was trying to work when one of the floor staff came in and took my shoes, I did not ask for a shoe shine and he was almightly put out when I did not tip, he hung around the room, then bought in a fruit plate, again I did not ask and finally a plate with two cookies on it again I had not asked.  This is a real turn off and the situation is betting worse.  Add to that the smoke sensor in my room was covered in plastic so that it could not work and that there was no power socket in the bathroom and lastly that one of the telephones did not work  Not a good stay and `i will look elsewhere next…",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

I ordered room service for lunch and it was enough for 2!  The next morning we had a long conference and the ambience was brilliant.

Not knowing what the protocol was, we offered her a tip, which she politely refused.  That was the start - the rest got better over the days.

Linnet Moses,"I visited Marco Polo, Pearl Continental Karachi for breakfast buffet with family and friends. Preliminary the discount that we acquired was incredible and one of the foremost fascination for people who love relishing buffets.  The dishes available were good and very appetizing, just should have added a fish or mutton element to it and this would be absolutely outstanding. The paratha and nan should have been made right there and then. Plus the refills were taking too long.  My overall experience was decent and remember-able. I would certainly recommend it to other people. Mr. Umar Hanif Akbar was serving us.",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

We booked executive suites on 8th floor and not only our suite was up to the standard but also we had complimentary executive lounge services.   One downside was the fact that they only combined two standard rooms with different configuration rather than offering seemless and combined suite (say with one large wash room with bathtub rather than two same size simple washroom). Surprised to hear that one has to pay almost 800 PKR for DVD system rather on on demand video system quite prevalent in 5 star hotels world-wide even in Nishat lahore.

It was really uncomfortable and after trying to sleep for 2 hours I had to ask the reception to change my room at 2:00 am. The other room given to me was ok. But I was a fool to think that it is going to be better onwards as this room had very poor wifi reception so I was unable to cinduct important business matters.

Firstly it is filthy and I mean the entire hotel. It is truly disgusting, I wiped a towel on the bathroom floor and it was brown. so I boiled water and ordered more towels and washed it myself. The gym had not be clean ed properly for months if not years. The public areas including restaurants were so dirty and unclean. I could not eat anywhere in the hotel. I complained and felt the staff just did not care! I stayed just 2 nights but it was rancid, I can not believe the reviews I read it has no relevance to the property and the internet does not work.

Lorenzo34,"I stayed in PC for three nights end of April. Asked for a non smoking room and it was a bit weird because non smoking rooms are spread in between smoking rooms on 7th floor (executive floor) even though there is no smell in the room you will start smelling smoke in the middle of the night due to heavy smokers. They need  a complete non smoking floor.  AC is very noisy even you shut it off you can't sleep due to noise from chillers outside. Ask for a room overlooking Street, you can't sleep properly if you have a park view room.  PC accommodate one of the best restaurants in Karachi. Tried Pakistani and Stakehouse both is good.

Tayyab Bin Tariq,"Good hotel located in a secure area. The services are really great and worth mentioning. The rooms are comfortable, but not so spacious. The hotel has done some renovations lately, and is in very good shape. The food is also good.   One great thing about this hotel are prices, you can buy anything from within the hotel on the market rate.",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi
BigDadd,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at end of October for a business trip. Hotel is operated by a local chain and not managed by one of the international brands.   The hotel ticks all the boxes for good security, safety and location for a city like Karachi. The staff are very keen to impress and hotel has good selection of restaurants. Morning breakfast spread is good.  The fitness centre has good selection of equipment.  However, hotel is showing its age (it is old) and cleanliness could be better. My bath towels were stained.   According to the locals this is one of the better hotels. ",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi
Aminuddin O,"My stay was comfortable at your hotel but there was one problem which was rectified later in my stay. In my bathroom, the commode was leaking.

Firstly they didn't have any of the rooms I had reserved so they gave me a courtesy upgrade.  Room was clean, food was fabulous and staff was humble.  Pakistani hospitality at it's best!!

Amer Q,"I was very happy to be upgraded at the time of check in to an Executive Room. The room was nice and spacious with a good outlook. The furnishings are very nice and there was ample space for me to work, I found the bathroom to be too small and a hassle to get in and out of. Given the high cost of the Hotel's rooms and the five star rating, the bathrooms could be better and more spacious. Overall, I was very happy with the stay.",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

But this last time which was 2 weeks ago, the hotel lost its classic and high end feeling all together. 1) the room assigned had such a rotten mutton grease smell I could not stayed in the room until the sprayed air freshener, even then I smelled it from my pillow, from the closet, etc; 2) they put 2 banks in the hotel lobby only 15 feet apart, one playing piano and saxophone and the other playing guitar and they were clearly competing against each other.  The music instantly became annoying sound.  I must add the ground staffs in the lobby and behind the front desks were very, very accommodating and helpful as usual.

Waqar A Chaudhry,"PC Hotel in Pakistan is known for being one of the best Hotels to stay in but I fear that it's simply riding on its name to hang around. I'll start with the best things and work my way down.  Firstly, at reception Imtithal was brilliant - always cheerful helpful and attentive to your needs, recommended a fantastic set of restaurants just past Clifton, the kind of service I would expect from a 5 star hotel.  The breakfast is great - has a wide selection and you can request whatever type of omelette you wish to eat, also offers great view from the 10th floor. Starts from 0630 to 1030 daily.  The outside security at the entrance of the hotel are great however the security staff outside who look after the cars are extremely annoying.

Based on my global experience, I would rate it max of 3.5 star hotel. I did talk to their front Manager and he committed to improve but there are tons of things to bring it at a 5-star hotel. The executive room was very average with broken cabinets, small bathroom with corrosive tabs and shower hinges and missing fillings in many areas. Non working thermostat. You have to turn it off if you feel cold.  No bathrobe or any elite stuff in the room to make it an Executive room.  Executive lounge exist but very limited stuff with no cooler to choose any drinks.

I am going to mention a few names here, not just because they are outstanding at what they do, but their flawless work will make them almost invisible during your long stay.  Luggage : When you're staying for over a month, you will have more luggage. You're going to need a bigger room. 5th floor corner rooms offer that. We downgraded from the Executive to the 5th for the space. It was Mr Tabish during the night shift who showed us about half a dozen rooms at 3AM so we could accommodate our luggage.

Not that it is not available, but that they never made any handicap accessible rooms. We decided to stay and manage despite that.  When we got to the room you could wipe the dirt with your fingers. It seemed like no one had used or cleaned the room in a long time.  We called them to clean the room.   Because of a death in the family we had to check out 8 days earlier than scheduled.

Saim Idrees,I had a great time here. The only reason for a 4 star review is that I made a booking on telephone and while checking in I was charged PKR 4000 extra for 2 nights and upon asking they just said 'umm don't know may be some confusion'. This hotel serves amazing breakfast with good variety. The service is excellent and hospitality is great. Facilities like super store/medical store open till midnight are really useful. FREE AIRPORT TRANSFERS which is common in Pakistan but not so much around the Globe. So that's a huge plus point.  Have always stayed in PC while visiting Karachi. ,4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

The facilities from the gym to the on-site restaurants and stores were adequate for a property of it's stature.  Wasn't blown away, but wasn't disappointed.  Rooms were nicely appointed and comfortable.  What set this hotel apart from many hotels that I had stayed out was the outstanding service.

I have not seen any other hotels here, so can’t comment but I would say that is 4/5 stars for 3rd world location. Ie this is not equivalent to a 4 star hotel in Sydney.  Security was a concern for me but the hotel has strong security measures (armed guards, all cars are bomb checked on entry, all bags are scanned at entry) so I had no issues there.  Staff are friendly and eager to help. English is partly spoken by most (but not all).  Food is very good, and I did not get sick 👋 but still got to try the quintessential Pakistani cuisine.

Snr DS,"Stayed a night at PC Karachi. Good room (Pearl King, 4th floor) with enough furniture. Went for Hi-Tea which was from 4 to 7:30 pm. Variety of dishes with drinks to suit almost all ages and tastes. Breakfast was also good with a lot of variety. In fact “Marcopolo” hall was over crowded at breakfast which shows its popularity. Atmosphere was serene and staff was caring. Ordered dinner in room. Both the main dinner and tea later on, were good. CONs : bathrooms are bit small and mattresses should be changed since these are spring  mattresses and having been worn-out, the springs can be felt when you are lying on them. That creates restlessness. Overall, a good place.",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Shahab R,"Had to write a review this time to reflect my experience at this hotel. I was arriving in the country after years and in the middle of a pandemic and did not want to risk taking a regular taxi ride, I had categorically requested an airport pickup at reservation and made a phonecall to reconfirm this a day ahead. Left stranded. Without a local number, I am forced to hire a ride with an uncle who was convinced coronavirus was a gas released by the government. No mask or sign of a sanitiser (you wonder why so many travellers to/from Pak test positive). Met at the hotel by a disingenuous apology by the on-duty manager Farhan who insisted he had no flight details until I pointed these out on his own reservation sheet. Early onset desi behaviour. You might think a missed pickup alone…",2,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Saif,My Stay at PC karachi was yet again a good one. The staff was very courteous and made sure that I was comfortable throughout. I liked the food quality as well as the cleanliness. The only issue I thought with the PC hotel Karachi is that they are not making sure that their guests Follow the SOPs during the Covid-19 Pandemic. I saw a lot of guests breaking the protocols and not even wearing their masks. I would appreciate if the management of PC could become stricter with the SOPs and told all their guests to at-least wear masks.  Other than this it was a perfect stay. Mr.Asad and Chef Fida at Grapewine Cafe were really great and courteous. ,4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Their food was clean, fresh and tasted good. Mr Raza and Mr Nasir were usually the ones bringing us our 1st meal. Mr Prem Chand took care of our early evening orders. Had some very interesting conversations with Mr Prem. Was always a joy to have him at our room door steps.

Thomas R.,"The Pearl Continental is a centrally located business hotel. Above all the safety precautions is an important factor in a city such as Karachi where security is an issue. The Hotel looks like under siege. The access is protected with barriers, isolated from the road with a container wall. Sniffer dogs check each vehicle. At the entrance baggage is systematically screened. Strolling around in town is not recommended, it is therefore essential that all necessary services are available in the hotel compound.   Rooms are spacious. The oversized double beds provide a good night's sleep. The equipment looks a bit outdated, but everything is clean and in good condition. A good selection of TV channels in English is available. WIFI worked well. The bathroom is equipped with a shower…",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

HeidiStruiksma,"Hotel had a nice ambiance and in general helpful & friendly staff. Executive room was comfortable and well equipped. This included the provision of sockets for all types of plugs (thank you!). Large choice of restaurants which looked nice & cozy. Breakfast spread was vast catering to different cultures. Although there appeard to be lack of herbal tea options. Food & service in Tai Pan (Chinese) restaurant was good and portions large, so one order can be shared by two. Overall a brief but pleasant visit. ",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi
Ozgur Celik,I stayed around 2 days in this hotel. The breakfast and dinner was not international. It was mostly Pakistani food however dinner was so delicious and fresh food. The laundry was so bad.

TravelBuggy2,"I stayed here for one week and the hotel was good. Beds are comfortable, rooms are spacious and many accessories in shower for guests. The toilets though have exposed piping and are not attractive and the mirrors and exposed metal surfaces are somewhat rusted and old. A renovation is needed. On some occassions we did not get towel replenishments, body soap replenishments or toilet paper replenishments and had to seek smeone out to bring them in. They also rarely clean out the shower drain and we had a minor flooding incident in the room because the shower flooded. Room service food is good but delivery could be faster. But overall we felt safe in the hotel, enjoyed the lovely japanese restaurant upstairs and vast lounge downstairs.",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

aza1974,"In Karachi you have only 4 five star alternative ,which I beleive some can not be considered more than 3 ...Marriott and PC are the best ..If you consider also hotel dining posibblities.I would suggest PC as they had a very good japanese and steak house plus breakfast is more mediterenenean touch ( olives and plenty of cheese) ...Free internet is quite speedy ... Only annoying part is if you had a late night check in ...Recepionists are so slepy and slow with documents..In most hotels specially for the visitors using hotel pick up service all papers are prepared earlier to speed up the process.",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi
Wangtshuk,"Arrived at the hotel around midnight after a late night flight from HK, got picked up at the airport by the hotel car with no problems, check-in quite fast. Lots of security outside as others have mentioned to put you at ease.   Got a room on the 1st floor, room was decent apart from the TV remote missing the battery cover and the batteries looked liked some one had chewed them to get some more juice out of it, something my younger brother did 15 years ago.   Bathroom had no toilet paper holder, seems it was taken off as the toilet door would slam into it. The pillows were too soft and gave no support.  The breakfast buffet was quite basic.  During checkout a manager approached me and asked how was my stay, I told him it was ok and about the TV remote, He said he would look…",3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi
Malik A,"You will begrudgingly go through security at the entrance of the hotel, but the measures are appropriate, considering the city's turbulent past. In the heart of one of the biggest cities of the world sits this proud monolith. The overriding attraction that any visitor will value is the hotel's location in the city; the central business district is at a stroll's distance and a few minutes' drive will take you to the city's social mecca. The rooms are kept in good order and the room service is excellent, although a bit pricey. But this is amply made up by the fact that you are surrounded by scores of restaurants with varied cuisines to choose from. The massive marquee can hold any corporate function or wedding ceremony holding upwards of 500 persons.",4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

The rooms are good and clean. They have done a good job of keeping the hotel in good condition.  The main restaurant on the ground floor has a good spread during high-tea. There are many other restaurants and a wide variety but we did not get a chance to try them on this trip.  The service is good and they even helped us to get the pillow type of our preference when we made a request.,4,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

Hman,Im from canada and this was my from time going to pakistan and seeing a hotel like this. Knowing karachi is like a 3rd world country i did not expect much. But it really was amazing the butler service literally got me anything i wished for and never even asked for a tip. I never saw a butler not smiling. They even waited for me at my hotel room while i was about check out waiting to take my bags. I really do understand why this is a 5 star hotel. I was on floor 8 and every single butler was so respectful i was never disrespected once. Special shoutout to aroofa and Ishtiaq. Take care.

The toilets also need to have some attention espcially these humongous toilets and then there's no space left for your legs.

thane h,I have stayed at the PC before and normally enjoyed my visits. But  this time I was seriously concerned about COVID and the fact that the Hotel is not taking steps to protect their guests in the restaurants.    All restaurants ONLY offer a buffet service.     This means the food and serving utensils can be contaminated by guest if the have the COVID virus which of course is very easily passed on.  There are no measures to  limit the number of guests that can approach the food containers.    The Marco Polo restaurant is especially bad at breakfast time when it is packed at popular times.    In UK all restaurants MUST only offer table service and unless the PC adopted same service i shall not return until COVID is clear.    I fully understand why the PC operates this way but…,3,Pearl Continental Hotel Karachi

The entrance to the hotel, gives you that safe yet comfortable feeling. The hotel looks high level as soon as you walk into the lobby, with a bakery to the left, Chinese, Japanese, and rooftop steakhouse on the premises, so good food is not far away. A bit pricey maybe but for a hotel of this level good for value. Rooms are comfortable with a good selection of English channels. Food ordered from room service was fine, serving size enough for two and delicious albeit a bit spicy for me.

They always block your way in elevators and have no courtesy how to behave in an elevator while a family is already in there. So you have to be like them to treat/ pay back them in their own shoes.

TashTash,"1st day  stay, the electricity came back at 9 pm and the night was good. 2nd day we left early in the morning and came back tired at 5 pm to a 40 degree room. Upon inquiring, the staff confirmed there was electricity problem most of day. Oh and I also killed about 10 flies in the room. Do your research as some others have said! This is a scam at best in my opinion as I have paid $2300 for a 3 day trip. What an awful experience and what a tragedy to the beauty of this location. By now they should have refunded the money even though vacation experience has still suffered badly.",1,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Lels,"My husband and I stayed two nights here as part of our honeymoon package. We booked the presidential suite.  We were severely disappointed. To get to the room we had to walk down a narrow cobbled walkway (not great for health and safety). When we arrived at our room the whole outside of our room was under working construction. Not the noise you want on your honeymoon. The room was dirty with stains on the bedding, furniture and curtains. The room was very worn and tired. For what we paid I was disgusted with the dire state of the room. We asked for an iron and what we received was a black burnt out 1950’s style iron with a stained ironing board. We complained to reception and they replaced the iron with another burnt out iron!!!  We did complain to head office in Lahore who were…",2,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Zaurayze,"As far as location goes, you cannot go wrong by staying at Luxus. Even though there are more choices propping up around the lake, Luxus has by far the best views. They have also ensured that you won’t miss any of the moments but setting up picture spots around the hotel garden area.  We stayed at the presidential suite for a night and the size of the room, and the 180 degree views were quite superb.   However for the price that is charged, the place lacks some basic amenities to justify the value for money. The food is not top notch, and in general housekeeping in the rooms was lacking. Also while the views were amazing, one would expect better items like curtains, better sheets, pillows etc which should be standard for the amount that you pay to stay at Luxus …   It is a good…",3,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Burhan M,We booked the presidential suite and the location of the room is just fantastic. We loved the room as well as the overall location of the hotel. The staff are very considerate and food is also quite good.   The only concern was the response time of the house keeping. Just too slow and they need constant reminding to get something done. The issue could be that they do not have any direct extension which is usually the case in every hotel. You have to dial the reception to convey the message. and you have to do it multiple times to get the job done. To add the key card stops working for some reason. Had to change our key card 4-5 times in our 3 night stay. and its a very long walk from the presidential suite to the reception.  Internet was very poor. The engineer was nice enough…,4,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
MH,"Don't be lured in by their great marketing skills and Instagram account - that's how we landed here. After following their page for so long, we just had to spend some time at the property soaking up the views and relax.   Pros: - great location, unparalleled views of the lake  - modern rooms/bathroom (albeit pre-fab and not proper concrete rooms) - good pitstop from altit/karimabad to khunjerab pass  - great breakfast buffet: from omelette & waffle bars to the good old halwa puri nashta  Cons: - resides within a landslide zone and is predominantly a live construction site (not at all relaxing when you've got construction workers walking outside your room and dust/sand blowing everywhere) Also they're polluting the lake. - sanitation in question, we arrived to dirty bedsheets.…",3,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
mansoor64,"Nice hotel.  Nicely built and lake view was gorgeous. Hotel staff performance was very suboptimal.  Several items from our room disappeared. We informed hotel person who was at the front desk.  He practically refuse to do anything and just looking at his response, we decided not to persue and left the hotel. I will recommend this hotel with caution.",3,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Arshad Wali Muhammad,I’m not very happy with the services they are offering compare to the price they charge. Staff needs lot of training and grooming. For each and every service we have to call them at least 3 times. The rooms become super hot after sun rise and ACs stop working. The bathroom had lot of issues and is not designed properly.   At the end I had a detailed meeting with the GM and have advised him to improve the service level in order to compete with other hotels.   For service complaints you have to run after them to get the things fixed.   Food taste needs improvement.

shanzabaig@yahoo.com,"Firstly is about the decor of the hotel and pictures hung in the entrance lobby. The hotel is sitting in the heart of Karakorum Mountain range surrounded by some of the world's tallest peaks yet their is no picture of any of those majestic mountains in the hotel lobby. Disappointingly so, there is a picture of matterhorn of switzerland hung which is a beautiful mountain tower yet no relevance to place and completely out of context.   Secondly the hotel has no provision or service for day visitors. We had to fight our way with the staff to get a cup of tea for a cost. The staff was adamant that kitchen policy doenst allow them to serve anything other than breakfast buffet. This was a put off as we paid PKR500 each for entry into the hotel and they showed no hospitality unless we…",2,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
muzafar2018,"I Went to Luxus Hunza on 26 Jun for one night with my family.  At the time of booking we were told that only the Presidential Suite is available which is the most expensive room on this property.  We really wanted to stay here so we paid 100% in advance 2 weeks before our arrival.  On arriving at the property everything looked great, but the first thing I noticed they only have one man desk who is dealing both check-ins and check-outs.  We arrived 30 minutes before the official check-in time, were the first people entering the property for check-in.  The reception guy was not doing anything at that time but asked us to wait because he is still finalising the check-outs.

Room: please stay in this hotel for at least 2 nights, one night isn't enough. there's some type of room, I choose the room in front of Attabad lake, so I can see Attabad lake 180 degrees from my bed. the room is so clean and modern, trust me this so comfortable. the room also complete with everything that you need like the fridge and electric jar. the toilet also clean and amnesties so complete.

Princen_Oranien,Staff was nice and I feel sorry for them because the reception room turns into their sleeping room at night. Air conditioners are there but as a decoration not functional. In room dining is more expensive than Marriot or Pearl continental so better to hike up the dust piles & buy food for 70% less prices. The views aren't really how it looks in the pictures. Once you book it there's no turning back from it since you can't cancel the booking.  The room rates are almost equivalent to what Grand Hyatt would charge which is just laughable.  We made a mistake of staying a day at Attabad lake which was absolutely waste.  ,1,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Zulfiqar P,"We were inspired by the Lahore reputation & booked Hunza expecting similar standards.  However it turned out to be a disaster .  The place is not yet ready for taking guests , it’s unpractical/ unprofessional & very uncomfortable .  Though we were informed that it has limited facilities at moment, they shouldn’t have started booking .  The staff deputed upon site are good , but not well trained, though courteous but poor people lack basic facilities to offer service.  The A/C units are fixed in rooms but not functioning  They expect guests to bear the Hot afternoons under steel sheet roofs of bed rooms & these roofs are not insulated so the air inside is an oven . You can’t stay inside without opening the door , that throws out your privacy & invite the flies into your bed…",1,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort

B Q,"I stayed her for one night as part of a tour of northern Pakistan. It was one of the places that we knew we had to visit. I travelled with 15 family members. The surrounding areas were absolutely beautiful.   Luxus Hunza left us sorely disappointed. The rooms were old, dirty and in desperate need of modernisation.   The outside areas were tacky, with artificial floral arrangements and grass.   Staff were kind enough but not enough to warrant us returning back to Luxus Hunza.",2,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Freedom00616038824,The gatekeeper wanted to charge 2k just for us to enter this crap of hotel and check their rooms. Rooms are very average and overpriced. Their restaurant menu is very limited. Leftover food plates from god knows how many days were placed outside the rooms. ,5,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
AJ1,"We visited the facility in winter with heavy snowfall. Rooms were heated and hot water was available round the clock. Rooms were of good size and comfortable. Tea making facilities are available in rooms. Rooms had a balcony with chairs and table and had a good view of Attabad lake. Bathrooms had all toiletries and 24 hour hot water.  Food prices are very high. Breakfast is included in room rent but was very spicy. They need to cater to all people with different tastes, specially foreigners. They made us non spicy omelette on our request.  Staff was helpful, specially Mr. Imran at the reception who went out of the way to help us.",5,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Sumbal96,"We arrived at this supposed 5-star hotel for our 3 night, 4 day stay. Things started off badly and only went worse from there…  We booked 2 presidential suite rooms for our family of 9 and the only presidential thing about them was the price! The rooms are not acceptable! We were promised (as per the website) 2 bedrooms in each suite but when we arrived we were told we had one king bed in the room with two mattresses on the floor. We paid 70,000 rupees a night for this per suite. The decor and bathrooms are less than average (broken doors/chipped paint/dirty sheets) and well below the advertised 5-star standard. There are no cups or spoons in the rooms and limited WiFi. We ended up getting an extra bedroom which was exactly the same as the suite (minus a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom) so really not much different at all!   The service at the hotel from the staff is extremely slow and the phones in the room don’t work. To get anything you have to ask multiple times and even then it may not come. To get to the room there is a long walk from the main entrance with lots of stairs, all in the open air. There is no lift and the hotel is over 5 floors, which isn’t acceptable for those who aren’t the fittest. There is rubbish visible on the roof and the smell of the outer area is very unpleasant. The road to access the hotel needs serious improvement as it’s definitely a health and safety hazard.   Some positives…the food was really good despite being massively overpriced. Also, there is a games room (despite this being outside and freezing in the winter), they do have a pool table, table tennis, karam board and lots of other games for children. Also, the shower has hot water access which was a plus.   Only someone being paid to write a 5-star review would give it 5-stars. My advice would be to wait a few years till PC or the new Serena hotel is built and visit the area then.…",1,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Abbas H,There is no local vibe at the hotel. Everything is so over priced (including the room rent) and the internet services are terrible. The staff is also not much of a help.

JT L,"Excellent stay of one night at this hotel. Very scenic location. Great rooms with large private front lawn. Great food and service. Rooms were clean and spacious.   The things that could be improved are: 1) Wifi was very poor… almost non existent. Frequent internet outages in the area so I’m not sure the hotel was at fault, 2) it was hard not to notice that every worker was eagerly expecting tips for every little service the provided. It was annoying and off putting to be honest.",4,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort
Khurram Hussain,"We stayed in Lexus Hunza for 2 nights in July 2022, which felt more like a city experience rather than the local Hunza culture and hospitality that we came to see.   What I think Lexus management has gotten wrong is bringing Lahore in Hunza rather than retaining local ambiance; the servers were dressed in western attire, live music was non-local, food lacked local flavor and to my surprise, I didn’t see many locals in their workforce either.   The location of the hotel was amazing, right at the lake; however there is still a lot of construction going on and access to rooms could have been better.   Overall, I think Lexus Hotel is overrated, way too commercial for my liking and doesn’t give you the local Hunza experience. I believe better options exist.",3,Luxus Hunza Attabad Lake Resort

Armish,"Stayed there for 2 days, here is the review:  1) The room facilities and services are great in comparison to other hotels in the area. 2) The staff is accommodating and helps in ways they can.  3) Morning breakfast is amazing and includes chicken, beans, potatoes, eggs, bread, tea and juice.  4) As with most of the good things there is a but. I must say the hotel has got covered parking which is tough to find in this area and this is great however the parking gets cramped and the parking staff isn’t so friendly.  5) One more thing is the slope to the hotel is a quite steep, so walking or driving up the road requires effort.   Overall, it was a good stay.",5,Hotel One Mall Road Murree

Alice M,"So the following morning when checking out we recieved a bill for the items that had been placed in our fridge which we believed were left there as complementary, which included 2 coca cola ,2 7up ,2 fruit drinks , 2 chocolate bars, 2 bottles of water and crisps and cashew nuts. So obliviously we ate some cause we believed it was included in our price as it was in the fridge and not explained differently to us.  So we had drank 2 bottles of water, 2 7ups, one coco cola and one chocolate bar during our stay. They charged us 1,300rupees (including more tax!!!)  for this !!! We were shocked that they hadnt explained to us about this i stated to him that if we wanted this stuff then we would of came down to the reception to buy. We felt it was a very sneaky way to make money. I…",1,Hotel One Mall Road Murree
muhammad r,"They will tell you rate 7000 rate minimum for one room and will not talk about tax, so when you have hired the room they will tell you it is 8200 so 1200 is tax. Further bring your extra mattresses with you because they will charge you further 1500 per extra mattress. So they will make sure that if you stayed once, you should never return to them. TV Cable will come very unclear on tv screen and very poor signal.  Before them in same building was JAVA hotel, and we even stayed here as less as 2500 rs per night, so now just because brand is changed 8200 for same room is not a good value for my money, will never return to this hotel again.",1,Hotel One Mall Road Murree

ski,The location of the hotel is great. Staff members manning the reception were courteous and helpful. We almost did not get the rooms that we booked. The room was basically clean but the bed covers and pillows were dirty. The housekeeping staff provided fresh bed sheets and pillow covers on request. The cleanliness of the room needs to be improved though. The staff was overwhelmed with the number of guests as the Hotel was full. The lock on the door was difficult to open.  The positive side of our stay was that the Hotel arranged one of our rooms so that our friends and family could dine together as the main dining hall was booked for the reception. Management went out of their way to make our stay comfortable but they were overwhelmed with a large number of guests so quality…,3,Hotel One Mall Road Murree
Haraf A,Hotel is located in front of GPO Murree where Mall Road starts. It is on a height from Mall road so if you have problem in climbing around 20 to 30 ft this hotel is not for you. Otherwise you need to have car to reach hotel every time. Hotel cleanliness require little attention shower area miss shower curtain in my bathroom due to which all bathroom got wet when we took bath even commode. Food was nice. And staff at reception and housekeeping was good and friendly. Room is not very big but even not small. View from deluxe room is good.,3,Hotel One Mall Road Murree
Gully Bhai,The word ‘courtesy’ has no meaning here. You have to compulsory pay Staff to get any service out of them. A highly mismanaged hotel.  Lighting is another issue. It feels dark on a sunny day. Employess on the other hand are not concerned to get the job done. The staff has know-how better then receptiinists and managers.  Furniture is old. Rooms small.,3,Hotel One Mall Road Murree

When we told them this was not what we asked for the manager who was a grinning idiot said you should have booked it through them direct as we booked it through booking.com then we would have known it was not 4 actual beds he refused to issue us a refund and just continued to grin with a sarcastic grin personally I wanted to punch the man in the mouth !! We left immediately, do not stay at this hotel I’m from the uk and this hotel would not even be a 1 star in England AVOID AVOID AVOID",1,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
JT L,"The only reason I gave a 1 rating is because there wasn’t an option to give it zero.  Not only did we have an absolutely horrid experience the single night we stayed there but it turns out the hotel is cheating customers out of their refunds as well.   I flew into Pakistan with my family of 4 after a long flight and originally booked 2 nights at this hotel thinking it would be somewhat comparable to the Ramada hotel in America. Boy was I wrong!! It is not even remotely similar.  They are just using the name to get some name recognition to lure unsuspecting customers in.    After the horrible first night we immediately checked out first thing in the morning and checked in at the Serena. In short, the AC didn’t work all night in the heat and humidity so no one could sleep.  The…",1,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

A warm smile and an affectionate greeting from him every time to welcome us for the breakfast buffet and to make sure we were well served is highly appreciated. Thanks to Mr Waleed and his crew.

Changed 3 rooms in one day and eventually have given up. Carpet was damp , not cleaned with hair and the bathroom drains pipes probably smell. They need a massive refurbishment. All the window and curtains are dirty and broken. They seem to have tried fixing it but I can still hear all the noise from the highway outdoors and still bathroom full of hair-balls. Dreading the next 4 nights of stay.I hope there are better hotels in Islamabad than this.The place looks tired and run down and does not live to the the reputation of Ramada. Sorry but not coming back here again.",1,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

The rooms and indoor pool is nice. However, the beddings needs replacement and are uncomfortable since they very old and rough.  So if are looking for something cheaper than Sarena Hotel, Ramada can be a goof choice.",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

It's not suited for an overnight stay and more suited to those who are in town for a few days and have access to a car or ride sharing app. The room was small, good size bathroom, good wifi and good breakfast buffet.  No electric kettle in room, the room was not very clean upon checkin and we also spotted a small cockroach later in the evening in the room. Be careful when ordering room service and try to order food that would be made fresh. We ordered biryani and pizza. Pizza was tasty but too small and biryani tasted like it was heated in a microwave.  Overall the price paid for the room was not worth it.

ZillNiazi,"The hotel is at a prime location, the property is very nicely built and done, however, they could improve their services immensely. The staff smelled - literally - and this was reported. The bedsheets and pillows they carried smelled too despite being clean because they must be holding those close to their bodies. The food is not too good in the only restaurant. The breakfast is just OK; no fresh juices or fruit. Ramada offers a good price package and great air conditioning, but each time the power would go out it would flood the room with light with every light being turned on. The touch system bedside console doesn`t work and turns every light on after every power reset. There was some issue with their power and it went out some fifty times each night that I stayed there.",5,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

The first time the check in was very poor,three men behind the desk all talking to one customer and completely ignored me, perhaps because I am a 65 year old woman. A man eventually turned to me but took three telephone calls in preference to checking my husband and I in. Eventually he palmed me off on a woman colleague.  We had a perfectly nice room on the third floor. Check out took a considerable time, the woman clerk seemed very unsure how to operate the computer system and got no help from a male colleague who preferred to ignore us both.

We booked a hall for my wife's 40th birthday on 18th August, weeks in advance. In fact, we had settled the total bill with Mr Ihsan Khan almost a month ago.

When I could not get a room at IC I was anticipating a below average experience like in all the other motels in the locality.  But instead, I was pleasantly surprised with what awaited me at Ramada. A very fancy hotel that meets most international standards. Nice cozy rooms. Very courteous staff...good food...reasonable value for money. I would definitely stay here again.",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Breakfast is good and so is the health club! However, if you fancy a shopping go to Centaurus where the prices are fixed!   Looking for the first copies of the bags; visit four square in F6 Near United bakers!   fancy a dinner go to zamana in serena which is the best hotel in town and 15 minutes by walk or simply take a cab!   You can in box me if you need any assistance! ",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

caro l,"On the plus side, the hotel has very good security, and the food was good with a wide selection (nice buffet available every night on the roof terrace which has nice views). The staff were friendly. The bed was comfy. The wifi worked well.  On the negative side, the decor in the room was very tired. The two armchairs had really dirty arms and the carpet and curtains were stained. Luckily the bedlinen was clean. I had to ask for the room to be cleaned 3 times because they did not do a good job (just changed sheets and towels but did not clean the surfaces properly). The rooms are not very isolated from the outside so there is road noise and wedding parties in the hotel which on one night kept me awake until 2am with loud music. There is a gym but ladies only have 2 hours in the…",3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Its nothing fancy, but you do get coffee and high tea snacks with TV access. Rooms are clean and nice. Staff is also helpful, they provided me with complimentary water whenever needed (a big plus!)

Apart from food, I will recommend this highly.",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

The staff are friendly and helpful, and the USD rate is very cheap when compared to similar international hotels in other countries.  The food was buffet with very similar or the same options every day - some variety wouldn't go amiss.  It's okay for a few days but I was there for longer so the food became boring.  The checkout process also took an age - about 30 minutes.  I don't know why it took so long as they must do this many times every day but it was a little annoying.",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

On the very first night there was gas leakage in my very own room (you know...the gas that comes in cylinders and used by cookers....just to give you a simple idea). I woke up 4:30am with the gas smell felling my lungs. They moved me to another room. One day later during the daytime I was walking in the corridor heading to the lift, smelt gas again. I went to the duty manager, accompanied him to the spot, he smelt and admitted yes he could smell gas.

To begin with, I have yet to come across such an exceptionally courteous staff that caters to your every concern; from the guard at the reception up to the guy who serves you tea & biscuits at 3 in the morning. Simply WOW. The highlights for me were the rooftop barbecue dinner & the steam/sauna in the health facility in the basement. Swimmers have the chance of diving into a temp-controlled pool as well. Furthermore, I would always look forward to the “mix chai” they served at the hotel; a perfect example of something as simple as tea that could be delicious beyond your imagination. Even more impressive was the scheduled…",5,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Due to a last moment change in plan I couldn't get booking where I wanted and accidentally stepped in Ramada Islamabad. We were taken by surprise to have the impeccable service level right from the Parking lot, till we checked-out. Front desk staff was extremely pro-active & ready to offer any assistance whatsoever. Though each hotel staff deserves a thumbs up, however Mr. Najam must get a special mention here. All in all great work Ramada Islamabad & keep up the good work!!

The bathroom was a little small and could use a makeover.  Breakfast was disappointing, particularly as there was only instant coffee available.  However, the level of service and attention from all the staff was second-to-none and more than made up for any other shortcomings.

I did have a problem with an spotlight over the door that would not turn off when turning in for the night; however, the next morning housekeeping promptly took care of it.

Buffet dinner also offers variety of traditional food at roof with a good view of the city.,5,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Ruby_Rayy,"The bed is heat sensitive which meant even if the room was cold with ac on, the bed was stifling hot. Also the door alarms on other rooms keep going off constantly so I hardly slept in this hotel. The hotel and room itself, is nice. Complimentary breakfast is good. Food ordered by room service was not good, tea was lovely though. The staff do not speak good English which meant I was given the wrong information on 3 occasions which left me feeling ripped off and very unhappy, especially as I tried to confirm the details numerous times. I complained to the manager who didn't seem to care that I was advised incorrectly.",3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
AmirJahangir,Ramada is a good Hôtel in Islamabad slightly away from the city traffic and noise.  Their food is excellent and can be counted is the best buffet in Islamabad.   The rooms are also clean and good in size as well. ,3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
ZillNiazi,I stayed at Ramada at two different instances and both the times the experience was horrible. There was no air conditioning and the rooms were stuffy. I reported that to the manager and his response was that since they were offering me exclusive (slightly low) rates hence I had no right to complain! I later reported that manager but I don't think anything happened as he was still there during my second stay. There was yellow water coming out of showers. The room I was given had stables of Islamabad Club in front and the air reeked of manure. A horrible place to go to and stay. It's better to at other options than to stay at Ramada Islamabad.,1,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
Akifa I,"Ramada Islamabad exceeded my expectations. Good and clean rooms, nice food with a lot of variety, friendly and helpful management and courteous staff. I would definitely recommend friends and colleagues to go for Ramada in Islamabad.",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
hamerah7,Ramada is known internationally so I thought staying here would be safe .  The place itself was lovely clean and of a high standard but the service was attrocious . They conned an extortionate charge on day one and when confronting reception on day 2 they had the gall to say it was usual practice to be scammed on your first day . I made a formal complaint to the manager about the charges who seemed at first to take it very seriously asking me to put it in writing. So I did but nothing came off if . The lights went out and one of my companions slipped and sprained her ankle so she checked out the same night but still they tried to charge us for an extra night . Then kept us waiting 3 hours to investigate only to tell us they had made a mistake . We could have stayed at numerous…,1,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Bilal J,"Visited Ramada for a business conference. The rooms were adequate but could use better cleaning. The housekeeping should be better trained.  Wifi works well and I appreciate this. Elevators had a glitch where rooms were being skipped, so I opted to take stairs most of the times.   I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast and honestly the gentleman making the omelette deserves a raise. I've eaten all across North America and his omelette was one of the best I've had. Even delivered it to my table by himself.   Laundry services were accomodating of my tough schedule and pressing was one of the best I've had in a while.  Rooftop BBQ can use better service but overall adequate. As it's a open concept, I felt that food wasn't warm enough but a chef was delighted to cook a new batch.…",3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
Amir S,"The hotel overall is fine with nice venue and restaurants. But I was shocked when I checked into the room that the carpet had large black stains on it as if no body bothered to clean it. Although I had advance booked as a solo traveller, the bed was laid in hostel style (two half beds on two sides of the room). I got that changed to a king side bed and proceeded to have some rest as I was too tired.   When I woke up and went to washroom, I realised that it was not cleaned well. Also the towels were damp and not fresh at all. Also some of the lights and buttons in the room were malfunctioning.   I noticed later in the day that there were long hair in the beddings. By that time I had had enough, so I asked hotel on my way out to meet some friends that I need the room cleaned. When…",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Naum1,Hidden Gem. It is strange why people don't mention it much. The perimeter is securely guarded. The reception staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are comfortable with a nice view. The health club and swimming pool are very well maintained. The restaurants serve delectable food. Room service is efficient and friendly. Ideally located away from the bustle of blue area but close enough to places of interest. Would definitely recommend this place for family and business trips.,5,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
Dr. Fouad A. K.,"While driving myself towards Ramada, Islamabad through M2 motorway, I was anticipating to check-in at Ramada, freshen up and drive to Murree to have lunch there. A very impressive facade when I was driving inside the parking lot of Ramada Hotel and a 'courteous' staff.   Good spacious lobby of the hotel and the dining hall.   Despite my booking 20 days back, the guy at the front desk could not find my name who I helped later to see in the same list he was having in front of him before. Three times I asked him to check me in over a duration of 30 minutes, so that I could follow my plan to drive to Murree. It took 40 minutes to get inside the room after all the formalities.

Farooq W,"Visited with my family and booked interconnected rooms as the rooms (executive ones) were 2 small. The check in was really slow and the attitude of reception staff particularly lady named Fahada was pretty cold and somewhat rude. Inquired if she is being paid and was surprised to know that she got her June salary in full and in time. No fruit basket in room. Old run down toilets. Safe box in one of the rooms was closed by previous guest. Used the one in adjoining room. Pool was open at the time of check in. When I went there along with kids after 1hour of check in, I was told that its been closed and would open at 7 am next day. Went there again and was told that it would open at 9 am.

I wanna use the slipper but it looks like they wash the room slippers, even I ask for the new one and the condition is the same.

aaronma,"The hotel policy is that all rooms allow smoking. They turn off the smoke detector when a smoking guest stays in the room and turn it on when a non-smoking guest stays in the room. Yes, you read that right. Aside from the fire danger because newsflash a fire could start in a smokers room and it wouldn’t set off the alarm, I don’t wanna sleep in a room that smells like an ashtray. This is combined with having to wait to enter my room when I arrived at 8:30pm. Seriously at 8:30pm my room wasn’t ready. Maybe they were turning the smoke detector back on. Complete horrible experience and I wouldn’t stay here again for free. Deplorable hotel.",1,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

husna2018,There is no system of ventilation in most of the rooms. Windows are fixed and cannot be opened to have some fresh air at times. Some of the windows face the staircase and fixed too so you feel like enclosed in a box cut out from the outside world. Due to non availability of fresh air it becomes extremely hot at times and the Air conditioning system doesn't work too since its controlled from the main switch by the hotel management and even if you turn on the Aircon it doesn't produce any cool air.,3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Breakfast for 6 days is pretty much the same menu although they change the local menu daily whilst the Western remains the same. The food is rather delicious. Try the 'chai' (tea) with creamer already in it. It is so yummy!  Location is not ideal for touristy activities. There is nothing within walking distance. I appreciate the free airport transfer. Security is tight with two outside checkpoints and right in front the entrance, in a small building, there is an X-ray scanner that you need to pass through each time you return to the hotel. A bit daunting at first but I appreciate this level of  security for my peace of mind and safety.",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
marcvanren1,"A very nice hotel, complete with European facilities. The staff were extremely efficient and helpful. The food on offer caters for both Pakistan and western tastes, the mutton karai I had was delicious!! Security here is very strong, it is right next to the diplomatic enclave and has staunch security procedures in place to gain entry. The souvenir shop in the lobby was a godsend for me!! I managed to get gifts for wife,  3 children 1 stepson and an ex wife, all in one place!!! :)  If you are flying in or out of Islamabad, I highly recommend the Ramada. It is a 45 minute drive from the new airport, courtesy cars are available for airport transfers. In all I had a very pleasant stay.",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Outhman T,"I visit Islamabad every few months for business and this was my first time at Ramada, I usually frequent The Marriott.  It would be unfair for me to directly compare the Marriott and Ramada, as there is a 30-40% price increase for The Marriott and it shows why.    The Pool, Lobby and Amenities are superior at the Marriott, especially the in- house restaurants they have. However, the charges for room service, massages, etc are lower at Ramada.   The room was very adequate, shower was decent. However, the TV was small, hardly worked, remote control not work and even when it did the picture was grainy.   The staff here are very good, only blemish is that they knock on your door in the morning way too many times to give water or ask to clean.   Overall a good experience, but I feel…",3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

Atiq Rehman,"I stayed here recently but they charged me fully for stay and on checkout I was told that because I was leaving early and they charged full stay I was due a refund. Unlike most of the world where they refund on the card, they could only issue a local cheque. No idea what that means for foreigners but I was lucky to have a local bank. I was promised they would send cheque direct to bank. Since then I have tried to get any response from them without success. The hotel is good overall so the only thing that has let it down is the post checkout comms and no news on my refund. I warn all non Pakistanis to make sure when you checkin you are only charged for one or two nights and not the whole stay. I WILL NOT be staying here again if I dont get my refund. I have lodged a complaint…",3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

I do not usually write reviews unless I feel some strong urge to share my views about something outstanding with other fellow travelers.  The moment I stepped from the entrance of Ramada Hotel in Islamabad, it immediately struck me with its resemblance to Sari Pan Pacific Hotel in Jakarta, a hotel I considered as one of my most favorites while I was posted in Indonesia (2005-2008) during the Tsunami humanitarian response, and which is strongly underrated by many others.

The Ramada Islamabad was quite an experience.  When I arrived at the hotel, I was skeptical whether I would stay there or not and kept my chauffeur waiting enabling me to do a quick check of the hotel. I was impressed with how I was greeted with green tea served upon my arrival and with the very clean appearance of the lobby.  The check in process with Naveed was courteous and fast and then I was shown my room by Asif the concierge, who through my stay had a pleasant smile and was constantly helpful whenever I saw him in the lobby.

Our stay was good with almost no major problems. But I would like to add following things.   1: This is a bit old building and rooms and carpets show the sign. I think need to refurbish room and building at some stage.  2: Mostly Pakistani food is served.  3: Staff is very friendly and helpful. 4: I really like the roof top buffet which is great.  5: Food needs improvement almost same breakfast every day.

docabdulghani,It is an amazing building with very supportive staff. Because of its location which is far away from the main markets and visiting areas of the city.

The facilities which included swimming pools, spas and gyms were also great. The restaurants were also clean and nice. The rooms were clean and any issues with the room were delt with immediately.

behnam t,"Having an executive room for one night, i enjoyed a very good service including fruit, free refreshments, access to the lounge for coffee and sweets and more importantly some kind staff that were always available for help. On arrival, i was given the room at 9 a.m and a free breakfast as well, it was a great welcoming. I wouldn't say that quality of foods are similar to 5 star hotels but i was quite happy with it. At night my room was cold and they immidiately brought an electric heater for me. The dinner in rooftop was also good. I didnt have time to use swimming pool and jim.

husna2018,I ve been a guest in Ramada previously as well and found no issue of this nature however this time majority of the people in our group(official colleagues) who had dinner there had a stomach problem. It was the month of fasting and I din’t know may be due to less customers and sale their food was not fresh or some other problem but almost all of us had stomach pain and nuseatic feeling after having dinner. Apart from this one incidence i found Ramada  a good place to stay and enjoy the beauty of Islamabad.,3,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

aliwahab79,"From the very outset, Pakistani hotels are a class of their own. Many don't care about upkeep and the staff usually cares less about guests. Ramada Islamabad is an exception. We stayed 3 nights and the property and staff exceeded expectations. The rooms are spacious and bathrooms well equipped. The food is very nice too. The breakfast at Maira is well laid out with a nice mix of Pakistani and continental dishes.   Hope I can visit and stay again. ",4,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad
Mansoor I,Overall a poor hotel. The reputation of the name it caries cannot be seen in the overall management. Some of the rooms are so small its claustrophobic. some rooms have windows towards the lobby. the lobby noise comes throughout the day. ALL the rooms have curtains THAT DO NOT COVER THE ENTIRE WINDOW. Failed to understand if they were saving on curtains????? Sunlight comes no matter what you do. Don't have a dark room concept at all. WIFI is the worst i have ever seen in any hotel. Gets disconnected every 5 min or even less.,1,Ramada by Wyndham Islamabad

It was our first time here and I was unsure how it would go since they can either go very well or very wrong. Good news - arrangements were quite good and everyone left happy overall. The hotel is far removed from everything else but otherwise, I would give it a solid 8/10 for value for money, and comparison of services to the higher end properties in Islamabad.  Rooms:  Pros: The room was a decent size, clean, well lit and with a comfortable bed.

This a run down hotel as of Dec 2015, the rooms are in terrible condition, dirty off white carpets, old springy mattresses, dirty pillows, old sheets which were not changed before we checked in. I made a complaint and the sheets and pillow cases were changed but still not satisfactory. The toilet has certain smell, and when you use the shower the water will be all over the toilet.

It is 2 years old property but it seems  like walls can tell much more stories. In brief: - Housekeeping is extremely bad in the room and common areas. Regular maintenance is totally missing.  - omelette station was wrongly placed in front of the show kitchen without a hood, so you leave the restaurant smelly very bad - breakfast buffet not promptly refilled.

Came into my room and discovered there was not daylight as the window faced a hallway and even had a sitting group right outside my room. Asked for another room which i got after midday. Room ( 209 ) was large and good working space. WIFI is ok but is you need a strong connection ask for a room with an acess point close to your door. Large flat screen TV and a fair number of channels ( CNN, BBC, Discovery,Nat geo etc). Bathroom with a shower good water pressure. Bed was nice a comfortable.

BrownBear,"My family and I stayed at the hotel for 5 days recently, and for the most part the experience was positive - however there are a number of issues that need addressed by management to fully justify a 4* rating.  Positives - Great location - Staff are very helpful and a credit to the hotel - Quality of food at the restaurant and value for money - Clean comfortable rooms - Complimentary airport transfers  Negative - Kids not included in room count. We booked a twin room think it would have double beds. The room did not. Default deluxe room is 2 single beds. Definitely not big enough for a family of 4. Room occupancy should be inclusive of children and not just adults.  - Extra charge per night for mattresses for children. Again, if the hotel know there are children in the booking…",4,Best Western Premier Hotel Gulberg Lahore

The manager Syed Itrat Gillani was very attentive and professional in ensuring our daily comfort and needs.  We stayed for five nights.

Sohail U,"I have stayed at this place three times over the past 15 years, twice with my family of 6. This was only possible due to the kind and co-operative owner, who made everything possible and available for us.  The staff has been super friendly at all occasions, (new faces) since my three stays were spread over a 15 year time period so different staff each time. I guess if people come to this hotel with the expectation of a 5 star hotel then they would probably be disappointed. Not to say that the service is inferior but to highlight that this is a guest house and has it's own character.  I read some of the very negative reviews and do not agree with a lot of what's been written since my stay has been very pleasant each time. I think it's unfair to give such negative reviews to hurt someone's business.…",5,Royal Inn Hotel

Caroline,"Great service and amazing owners! Staff don't all speak English but surely great staff. 1,5 week before arrival the owner helped me with getting a tourist Visa to provide me the requested letter. Yes, they are muslim but what do you expect in a muslim country? Indeed Islamic norms and values. Nothing wrong with it!  Good Wifi available. For my work the Wifi in my room wasn't fast enough for video-calls but the owner gave me another nice, second, room just to do my work properly. For free.  The room-service was also really good. They even gave my several times nice fruit to taste: never thought there are so many fruits I didn't seen before :) Before leaving the hotel, to take my flight back, they recommended me to leave earlier because the road might be blocked which would lenghten the trip to the airport for at least 1 hour. The driver who picked me up at the airport brought me back to the airport in time: 4 a.m. he was ready to take me to the airport and I was nicely in time for my flight. Superservice!The hotelroom was huge: a really comfortable and bigsize bed and 2 sittingcorners in the same room. This really makes you feel at home and makes it perfect for a long stay.  The staff don't talk to much but this doesn't mean they don't do their jobs: After cleaning, the room was perfect clean! Nice bathroom with nice hot water.  Just ask the owners and they will arrange everything for you. Next time I will surely come back here!…",5,Royal Inn Hotel

The staff are very nice and go above and beyond. They let me check in early after arriving around 8 am. They provide a good breakfast. The rooms are large and spacious.

Any thing you want to have, they will provide you with... It's recommended to go there and enjoy your stay with a reasonable price of $40 per night with breakfast, at least ROYAL INN is my personal favorite go to place when I visit Karachi. Just a thing to say that their washroom size was a bit small but it's okaysih. but the pampering they do... just make it memorable.",5,Royal Inn Hotel

I went to a Karachi for an important meeting with a major corporation in Karachi, I booked a car from them, they called me 30 minutes prior to departure informing me that car was ready so they could charge me extra for the 30 minutes, I was out to the lobby within 10 minutes and the car was not present, they made me wait 45 minutes and I was about to miss my meeting when I called the owner he said he was on the way, never realizing to arrange the car for me to leave.

As they knew I am a bit disabled (can't walk much) they hired a wheelchair for me. The manager Mr Sheikh Khayal and the staff were always willing to help, specially with the internet service and anything else I asked for. Not many tourists stay there but I would recommend it to anyone. Breakfast is included in the daily price. All food or drinks ordered are brought to the room. TV is provided in the room, and a fridge. There is a garden where one can sit outside. They provide pick-up and drop to and from the airport, free for a week or more stay.",4,Royal Inn Hotel

Thumbs down for: after arriving in the early morning hours I told the staff I will extend my stay for 1 additional night and I will make the payment later the day after I had a proper rest. Staff assured it was no issue. I was woken up by a female staff by 11:30 am to make the payment and up from then she called every 30 min asking for the payment which was harassment. The night shift had assured me it’s fine to do it in the afternoon. My rest was continuously disturbed by this lady. She wasn’t polite either, I suggest a training for her.",3,Avari Xpress Gulberg

Other issues encountered were a fuzzy tv picture quality.

Anonymous A,"I stayed there for a week. The hotel and room was beautiful but its a shame that the staff let it down. The room was unclean and dusty. Staff didn't clean it properly and would leave it in an unhygenic state. Reception staff was extremely rude and when I complained, the following happend the next day: I deposited money and they did not send a receipt to my room as promised or update my account. Subsequently, when I told them the next day I had made payment, I was accused of lying and they approached one of my visitors for payment! Incredible right?! so I paid them extra to conclude the matter but refused to sign the final checking out statement as it did not show my deposited money. Later that day the hotel called me and told me they had made a mistake and would refund my money…",1,Faletti's Hotel
bojantercon,"We ended up loving Falettis. It's a hotel that grows on you. It's an old, somewhat grand hotel, with long corridors covered with B&W tiles and long shadows cast by the cast-iron grillwork of the windows.   The rooms are suite size, although the rooms on the ground floor are larger than the ones on the second floor. We came here twice so we tried out both rooms. Plus the rooms on the second floor have very small windows thus making the rooms darker, which is something I don't like.   The restaurant also grew on us. Not a massive selection for breakfast but eventually you found the things you liked - I ended up eating Pakistani eggs for brekkie every day.  Loved them!  The service is stellar.

Security is good and access to most parts of Lahore is good from this location e.g., 15-20 minutes to airport, Gulberg and some business districts.

SA312,"The hotel has a rich heritage with a history dating back to 1880. Compared to the other traditional big two hotels of Lahore, PC and Avari this is smaller and thus feels a lot more personal and attentive to each guest. Entering into the hotel feels as if you have taken a trip back in time to the days of the Raj.  I stayed with two children and the care shown by the staff was exemplary. My children enjoyed themselves thoroughly. When one of my children fell ill, the staff arranged a doctor for him themselves without asking. It really felt as if it was a home away from home.  The rooms are spacious, the beds are large and the facilities good. The inclusive breakfast buffet was of good quality with a Desi option rotating daily.

OmerI,"What's going for this property is its history and spacious colonial style rooms.   So this place was opened during the British raj by an Italian dude by the name of Joseph Falleti. Most locals will mispronounce it as 'Flattys', which is awkward but expected.   The hotel doesn't have a lobby so that makes it somewhat annoying. The rooms are not as clean as one would expect and the staff are lazy and not on their feet as they should be. Housekeeping is always trying to catch up with guest requests.   Having said that, it's still probably the best hotel in the city simply because it's spacious and not cramped. There is a garden and secure indoor parking (plenty of it) and a mosque in the back.   The breakfast, usually inclusive, is acceptable and edible.  Reasonably priced but not…",4,Faletti's Hotel

My impression of this place was quickly changed around the moment I drove in, it was as if being time jumped back into colonial era. The hotel’s facade and corridors, the decor still carried a lot of that vintage feel. Walking into the hotel and you get a photo collage of all their esteemed guests from Mountbatten, Jinnah and Nehru to the more recent ones like sir Gary Sobers, Marlyn Brando welcome you. The rooms however have been redone and are spacious and luxurious in every way.

On the other hand, it is a venue for weddings and other events (such as an university congregation and degree ceremony). I am not sure both go well together as the privacy of the hotel is jeopardised by large crowds coming and going and a congested parking. As in a boutique hotel, there is only one restaurant with limited selection of Pakistani and continental dishes or comfort food.

Waqas,I represent a private organization that has events conducted at this venue ever now and then. My experience with Luxus Grand has always been delightful. The halls are extremely well maintained and well managed. The rooms are superb and not at all cloister phobic unlike many other hotels the we have had experience with. The staff and services have always been impeccable and the hotel management always supportive and accomodating. Quality of has been top notch keeping quality standards to the maximum. Would certainly recommend Hotel Luxus Grand to anyone and everyone. Kudos!,5,Luxus Grand Hotel

Smaragda L,"Quiet, well-maintained hotel off busy streets and away from traffic noise.   The rooms are clean, complimentary coffee and tea as well as fruit, are included in the price. The breakfast is great.   Best thing about the hotel are the staff, who are super helpful and accommodating.   Downside: air conditioner is set on high temperature, and the rooms are very, very warm. Fan won’t turn off either. No outside space to relax in. These are small issues - the rest is great. ",4,Luxus Grand Hotel
Anya S,"The place is very nice, the food is decent but the privacy is appalling. Checkout policy is at 12pm. We went downstairs for breakfast at 7:30am. By 7:40am the staff, knocked on our doors to check our bags and minibar. Because we were downstairs we didn’t answer the door. Our dad was in the room opposite the hallway and heard the knocking so he went out to check. The staff opened room door without consent and even after my dad said that we’re downstairs but have not checked out yet. This is a breach of privacy. Again at 8:05am, my mum went back to the room’s bathroom, the staff knocked the door and and after awhile (my mum couldn’t open the door as she’s busy showering), the staff again opened the door without consent — to check the minibar again...whilst she was half naked in…",1,Luxus Grand Hotel
Ash,"I had a great stay at luxus. All staff were so helpful kind and put my needs first from bell guys to reception staff to house keeping to restaurant and room service and laundry. Taha, Umar hayat, Shakeel to mention a few were very helpful and organised my trip, late breakfasts, room upgrade, and coach timings... I definitely recommend luxus. I would hope that they had windows which open or air conditioning in this weather as the weather was not too hot or cold and sometimes felt stuffy at night.  This is my second stay and other than that I cannot fault it. I felt at home.  I like the fact that staff were open minded and were busy with their jobs ensuring that the focus is on customer satisfaction.  Good stay.",4,Luxus Grand Hotel
Madiha Z,"I have visited the hotel several times in last 2-3 years. Being a person who has alot mobility and i experienced almost every top hotel of the country so far. Its such a pleasure to see that the quality in almost everything has improved way too far than any other hotel. The promptness, hygiene, quality of trained staff, ambiance, food...name anything and it turns out to be the best. Even though i was keen not to experience a new hotel at first but i can happily admit my contentions being wrong because the so-called brands have not offered what this hotel is offering the guests... A FEELING OF BEING AT HOME...apart from the fact that luxus has set a high KPI for even the five-star hotels to follow...they offer a highly effective emergency exits...the understanding of their team…",5,Luxus Grand Hotel

shafiq1969,"Stayed in Luxus Hotel in October 2018. The hotel is located off a high street, which is great because you don't get to hear the traffic. The reception and check-in was timely and very efficient. Staff were exceptionally well mannered and professional.  We were upgraded to executive connecting rooms. The location of the hotel is central and it is very easy to move around Lahore from this location.  My son was expecting a proper Lahori style mega breakfast feast with Nehari, Paya's and Haleem etc. On the 1st morning they did not have all these items on the buffet menu and after we gave our feedback the chef changed the menu the following day to include Nehari!!!   Room cleanliness was good and beds were extremely comfortable.  Swimming pool wasn't heated but was there in full form…",5,Luxus Grand Hotel
Nigel A,"The experience begins with the efficiency of the enquiry and booking process. Upon arrival at Lahore Airport, the driver whisked me to the hotel where staff were extrenely friendly and welcoming throughout. The room was amazing too...and so quiet... I dined in the restaurant where the staff looked after me so well and the food was exceptional. The old city is a bit of a walk away...approxinately an hour...but the walk was fun. I loved my stay here as everyone works so hard to seek perfection.",5,Luxus Grand Hotel
TripistanPakistan,i am working on tourism industry since last 10 years mostly my guest comes from Europe and states . Few days ago a guest of mine from USA had booked the hotel before her arrival . She stayed 6 days in this hotel and paid the payment in advance . She demands several times for hot water but the staff denied as they committed to provide hot water and about the food is so tasteless she advised to staff that she needs coffee for morning in breakfast but they staff gave her only tea that is not able to drink as per my knowledge they charged much but the services is ZERO .  I will not recommend to any one for this hotel to stay or dinning here  I felt very bad to hear about views from my guest !,1,Luxus Grand Hotel
Ammar M,"Subject : Traveled from USA. Extremely Disappointed. Avoid it if you can. Please read this before booking!!!  I had a terrible experience from the very beginning and would like to share it so people who are planning on booking this hotel can think twice. Here is my experience  1) After reading great and positive reviews online and viewing perfectly Photoshopped pictures of the hotel I decided to proceed with my booking. As soon as the booking was confirmed, I tried contacting the hotel through email so they can arrange airport pickup. Either they never responded or they responded asking me Flight info over and over again even though I included all the info in my email to start with. Took me 2 weeks to finally get a confirmation.  2) When I arrived into the Hotel, the lobby is…",1,Luxus Grand Hotel
M14," Unfortunately the hotel is very noisy and bad isolated, so you will be able to hear other guests talking in their rooms. Also, you are able to hear music coming from the hallways and can hear the staff cleaning. The staff will knock on your door at least 3 times a day unexpectedly.. to ask if you need anything which is quite random.  The service at the restaurant is bad, you receive the food you order very late.  The breakfast is ok.   Other than that it’s quite safe and good looking hotel.   ",3,Luxus Grand Hotel
Canadian Traveller,"Terrific hotel in the hotel of Lahore. Rooms are comfortable and spotless. Staff and welcoming and go above and beyond to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Breakfast was wonderful, and offered few, but sufficient western options. Coffee was delicious! Complimentary water, toiletries were excellent and anything you needed extra of, housekeeping was more than happy to provide it! The only reason I did not give 5 stars to this hotel, is because upon checkout, the staff forcefully asked me to leave them a 5 star review and nothing short of. That’s a bizarre request, and 5 star reviews should never be forced on the client. Services and staff should speak for itself, and clients will happily give 5 star reviews where earned. As a suggestion to the hotel management, please…",4,Luxus Grand Hotel

The hotel cant be seen from the main road but once inside the entrance is beautifully decorated, with a warming lemon smell.  The staff were very friendly, the room was spacious and clean with all the tea/coffee and bathroom facilities. The breakfast was lovely especially the lahori halwa chanai puri.  The concierge service was great, they offered car rentals for a day or half a day around lahore, we paid around £30 for a 12 hour chauffeured car around lahore, visiting badhshai mosque, lahore fort, minar I Pakistan, lahore museum and waga boarder during this day with time to spare.

Check in went all good no problems but right when we got into our rooms the bathroom wasn't clean at all. We complained & they cleaned it up right away. Strange to have a untidy bathroom when u check in. Clogged tub & broken toilet flush. Outdated property with no renovation been done at all.  Stayed at PC to a night before compare both the hotels since this one is on top on booking.com but now I understand why.

Also we pointed out twice that the toilet in our room was running and didn't flush, twice they sent maintainance to ""fix"" the problem which both times still remained and we got tired of telling them to fix it.

If you want a clean and very comfortable hotel with excellent friendly service in a great location - this is the best in Lahore. We were upgraded to suites for free and there is complimentary milk, biscuits and fruit delivered to the room each day.

However, there’s still opportunities to improve; housekeeping trolleys and vacuum cleaner in corridors don’t set a good welcome. Breakfast staff just greet guests but do not explain anything which leaves guests to just wonder around themselves. Buffet was not refilled even there was 1 hour left to wrap up. Hotel gives a a very luxury ambience but a wow factor was still missing.

I love Pakistan, but there really needs to be some training on customer service practices.",3,Luxus Grand Hotel

Buffet breakfast was outstanding. So many options to choose from, including traditional Pakistani breakfast items. You can pretty much skip lunch after that breakfast.

The staff was friendly and diligent in getting us checked-in, making sure we had sufficient water, soaps, etc as well as providing us with our requested items (ironing board, laundry service, etc). My only issue with the room was that the bathrooms are very outdated.  On another note, come check-out time, they had not included our laundry charges in the final bill and called me later to come back and pay it. Rather unprofessional as that is something that should have been taken care of long before check-out.

I was skeptical - but within no time was put to ease.  The place (and I mean everywhere) was immaculate.  The room was HUGE -- and the bathroom felt it was even bigger :).   Even the food was better than expected.  I was craving a burger - and they sent one up -- even through it was not on the menu.  This has come on my list of places to stay.,5,Ramada by Wyndham Lahore Gulberg II

travelwithcarlo,"I was going to give this place 4 stars but what they did to us on the last night was unbelievable.  We couldn’t get on our flight at 2am in the morning, we returned to the hotel 2 hours later we had no other option we wanted to use the same room that we had already paid for but they said we could not. They charged us twice for the same night even though it was only for a few hours.  The greed & downright lack of compassion for vulnerable tourists was extremely disappointing.   The rooms are generally clean but we never had hot water in both rooms we used it was always cold, we mentioned this but nothing was done. In room wifi is also weak. ",1,Hotel Excelsior

Secondly, efficient staffs. every staff member I encountered, from the valet to the check- in to the cleaning staff were hospitable, responsible, delightful and eager to help! Lastly, reasonable price. Considering the amenities this hotel provides the guests with, this hotel literally has a reasonable price.",4,Hotel Excelsior

Malcolm Carter,"Before I start, I'd like to thank the management of Hotel Excelsior for their great service. I landed in Karachi on 5th October and decided to stay in Hotel Excelsior as it was more within the city and I wanted to experience the essence of the city of Karachi. As someone who is fascinated by the culture of South Asia, this place greatly captivated me. The Saint Patricks' Cathedral from the 19th Century was just a few meters away. With so many Eastern jewelry and clothes shops right across the street, I managed to get souvenirs for my family and friends back home and not to forget the food; even though a bit too spicy for my taste; was to die for.  The staff of the hotel was very cooperative and suggested places I hadn't hear of to enhance my experience.  So making the long story…",5,Hotel Excelsior
paulsnowyelsum,Travelling down from Australia for an expedition to K2 base camp and Nanga Parbat I had to stay  in Rawalpindi as my flight got delayed. Wanted to stay closer to airport and where I could have nice English food. The guide told me about Royalton which wasn't too expensive and the staff was very well behaved( you don't find that often in South Asian countries) and the food was out standing . Gotta chat with owner who was full of information about the northern areas having served in military he was a fantastic guy and so was his son ( should meet him). Ended up staying for couple of days . My next visit is soon n I reckon I will be staying there again . Highly recommended. Good value for money,5,Royalton Hotel
Jawad A,"I happen to pass in that area and was surprised to see a new hotel building. Ee decided to stop by for a cup of coffee, the restaurant was indeed very well set up, something you dont expect in this locality. We further went on ordering dinner. We ordered chinese platters. The serving was in good quantity and tasted equally delicious. At the same time, it wasnt too expensive like other posh restaurants of the city. We overall had a good dining experience and I surely recommed that it should be advertised more by the hotel management in order to spread their services Hope to visit again !!!",5,Royalton Hotel
carebears14,"We visited Rawalpindi for a family wedding and stayed at Royalton for a week. The experience was unexpectedly good. Since its a new place so my husband was confused while making the reservation, but I am glad we did it !! The best part was it had a beauty saloon and an easy excess to the shopping market. The services in the saloon were excellent, we got our make-ups done from there, the staff was friendly and helpful. After the tiring weddings we did had a body massage hehe which all of us enjoyed lol The only problem we faced was the road construction which was going on at that time, it made travelling time a lot more than usual. I will definitely recommend it to my friends and will surely stay here once i visit Pakistan again",5,Royalton Hotel
xon9909,"The overall environment of the hotel was good. Staff is very friendly and cooperative. The rooms are of good size and posses basic amenities, addition of a hair dryer would definitely be required. The main restaurant was very well decorated and furnished, the food served was also of very good quality. The best thing is the location, its very close to the main market area of the city and are easily accessible by all means of transport available. Presently due to some over head bus track construction going on in the city, the roads are blocked but im sure it is only a matter of few more weeks. This place will definitely be my choice to stay again Keep it up",5,Royalton Hotel
Ali Bin Nadeem,"Whenever I have to stay or any of my clients come to the city to stay, Royalton is the place. It is comfortable n has a very hospitable environment and yet very economically affordable.  The hotel has managed to live upto it's name in terms of class, and quality of service.   I believe when you know about something good u should always share with others.  Keep it up Royalton... good job. ",5,Royalton Hotel
Nassar H,"The Royalton Hotel is conveniently located less than a two minute walk from the new Metro Bus Station which gives easy access to prominent locations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The hotel reception was clean and welcoming; the check in process was smooth and efficient. The reception staff were professional and friendly. My friend and I booked a twin room on the fourth floor facing Liaquat Park, the room was comfortable and met our needs. The bathroom could do with an overall but everything was working and above all it was clean. We used room service on several occasions and found the service quick and professional. The restaurant is a great plus to the hotel, it is decorated to a very good standard; the food was exquisite and at a very reasonable price. I strongly recommend…",4,Royalton Hotel

As this is the only hotel maintaining it's standards of tidiness, room service, hosting and cooking. The management is well trained and polite si as the staff. The environment is family friendly with peace and Moreover you can enjoy Wifi also. But keep this thing in mind that it is a 3 star so keep your expectations as such.

umar z,"I organised my booking over the phone from the uk. 12 April to the 21st. I got picked up from the airport by a taxi organised by the hotel got charged 1000 rupees, much cheaper if I got the taxi from the airport. I booked an executive suite  it was nice and clean. I was not impressed with the room service. I went out and gave my room key to reception and asked for the room to be cleaned but when I arrived back it hadn't been touched. I complained and asked for fresh towels and toilet roll. You don't get fresh towels everyday you have to ask.  I paid for breakfast every morning ( very expensive ) considering a cup of tea is 20 rupees and 100 rupees including tax in this hotel oh yes everything tax is added I think 16%.

TM78612344,"Having been to lots of 5 star hotels I kept my standards average when arriving upon the hotel. Being a 4 star hotel i didn't expect the place to be over-powering with luxury. As me and my family needed a hotel near the airport to head off early morning, we looked at two hotels and Royalton seemed convincingly better. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a security gate and guard. We then were greeted to complimentary drinks as we waited to be checked in. Room key was handed to us and were escorted to the room. Overall the room was nice with nicely set beds and TV, view and fridge. Carpet was stained and bathroom was below hygienic standards.

The Royalton Hotel provides great service, fast free wifi and both the hotel GM Mr Tariq Murghal and Manager for sales and marketing Mr K Ahmed Khan were on hand to look after their guests. Mr Khan organised a taxi guide to take me on a tour and booked my return travel back to Lahore for me, very helpful. If you are a tourist or only speak English, this hotel will help you out very professionally. Thankyou Royalton Hotel!   ",4,Royalton Hotel
Shigri79,The best thing about Royalton Rawalpindi is its location. Its an economy hotel. Many foreign families were staying there when i stayed there. The top fifth floor is very hot so i would suggest to stay in other floors. The Air conditioners don't work on generators so you have to bear for 1 hr after every 4 hrs. Food needs a lot of improvement. Rooms are ok. Service is good but sometimes it lacks professionalism.,3,Royalton Hotel

Everything is excellent from the minute you walk in, room service, restaurant is excellent. Please don't be fooled into big name hotels PC or Marriot I've tried them they might be a bit flashier but believe me save your money and try this place. Rooms are very high standards against others around the area wifi, lcd TVs etc lovely size bed and comfy mattress for a nice sleep. I'm from the uk so I'm very fussy about cleanliness and comfort this hotel ticks all the excellent boxes for me. I'm returning back on the 19th with my family so I hope the high standards continue.

Rooms are still maintained well and the services offered are good as compared to the price you pay. The basement parking was full always, may be coz of the reason that its too hot out there these days.

Ozar G,I stayed at this hotel for 14 days. The rooms are clean and the staff is very polite and tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  The food in restaurant/ room service is excellent. Prices are for stay and food are fine.  As a European it was my first time in Pakistan and I have to say if you plan on going there keep in mind it's not Europe. It is nice but standards are a bit lower than in Europe. If you keep this in mind when you go there you'll have a beautiful trip and a happy time with nice people around you.   Only thing which I was disappointed of was that everywhere was written hotel has “Spa/beauty salon“ but when I stayed they didn't have. They said they had but it's closed now.   If I visit Rawalpindi again I'd love to stay there again.,4,Royalton Hotel

The room was a double but they fitted a double bed in a single room, shower toilet adequate but and this is a massive but, no hot water!!!!!   Luke warm was the best I could get and that may have been due to the sun shining on the water pipes outside! Evening meal was interesting .... ordered chicken karahi, which was very nice .

RazorsMahd,Wasn't expecting much but was surprised how good it was compared to Pakistani standard. The hotel is adequate for all your needs. The rooms are spacious and Wi-Fi is good. Breakfast was also good. Location is great.  Our only issue was we arrived several hours earlier than intented. We had 2 large rooms booked via Booking.com. Upon arrival at 4am we were told we would have to wait till 10am. We were tired after a long journey and just to relax. Our other room wouldn't be needed till later but the reception manager was not listen to reason. We said we would pay extra for the few hours but he wanted the full nights rate. Only after contacting Booking.com this was resolved. Infact they had both rooms free and available.   Once that was resolved the stay was very pleasant. ,4,Royalton Hotel

Few options for breakfast but the taste is really nice. Their ala carte food is great too. The only thing I did not like was their policy of not being allowed to order food from outside, hence the 4 star rating, what if I feel like eating from a famous pizza place it mcdonalds or anything like that. Other than that the hotel is great in every aspect",4,Royalton Hotel

A room a way from the full on traffic outside. And some sleep. Acceptable.  8 a.m. breakfast (included) produced yet another cold fried egg (prevalent on this trip into the NW Frontier) and ditto strange meat-like patties.

Staff was also helpful in getting taxis and negotiating fares.  Breakfast was fine. Initially the selection is disappointing but you can order coffee and eggs free of charge.

Waheed Ahmad Shah,"Room was not spacious and amenities were old. Furniture is needing some polish. I was not expecting an old style 19"" inch television in this era of LEDs. Refrigerator was empty. Water was provided by room service on  a cost. Room charges are quite high with respect to room size and facilities. Internet was amazingly fast, i downloaded a movie on 2MB/Sec:D reception staff is polite and helpful. But let me admit that this is the only choice if one have to stay in this area. Because other hotels in this vicinity are even more poor in rooms space and facilities.",3,Hotel Crown Inn

brian w,My boyfriend booked us in for a surprise stay on route to the National Park. He paid for an upgrade but must say we were both disappointed with the cleanliness of the room. I think it must be a cultural thing as when pointed out to the staff about the dirty toilet and sink they said they could not see anything amiss. There is much rubbish in the streets that does not appear to be collected so again Pakistanis must just think this is normal. Another word of warning do not show open signs of affection in public. My boyfriend kissed me lightly in the foyer and one of the staff shouted a loud rebuke. Strangely the same member tried to hit on Derick later that evening explaining that he like many other staff are still in the closet because of local preduces.,3,Hotel Crown Inn

And I’m always disappointed with this property no matter how much I want to like it. First of all, the property is extremely outdated and the only reason I stay here is because of my Bonvoy elite award nights.   I’ve decided to choose a different hotel in Karachi after my 2 week stay. Why, here is the down-low:  -Outdated property with extremely old fixings and rust everywhere.  -There is disgusting rust/debris on every stainless steel and non-metal structure in every bathroom, including the toilet, shower, and the corners of the shower.  -After house cleaning, there are ALWAYS hair in the shower or sink.

Secondly, the staff should make sure that guests wear masks while they are roaming and while they move out of their tables to take food but unfortunately the public was not following SOPs. Although the manager was asking the guests but they were not following the rules.

outnabout4ever,Had the pleasure of staying at the Karachi Marriott for a business trip.  We were here from the USA with a delegation.  Everything was top notch but I must mention the people that truly made our visit memorable.  Night shift supervisor Mr. Junaid Shakeel and bellman Mr. Tariq.  We had many requests at the middle of the night and these two gentlemen were always there to address our needs with a smile.  They are truly an asset to Marriott and we hope that they get recognized for their unparalleled customer service.  Well done gents and we hope to.see you on our next visit!  ,5,Karachi Marriott Hotel

Meanwhile, another Western guest was acknowledged and served immediately (even after arriving after me).

Farrukh Malik,i Stayed there for two nights. initially there was a problem in the room but they changed my room instantly without any delay. But the most important part i would like to highlight is the HONESTY.   I forgot to pick my AIRPODS worth 40K Pkr in the room and when i boarded at the airport i came to know that i dont have them with me. I called the hotel and they transfered me to the concerned department. They checked my airpods in the room and instantly said YES WE HAVE IT and above all they dispatched them to my address in multan without even asking me any cost of TCS.  I would like to appreciate Mr.Jameel Tanoli for his HONESTY and Extra Ordinary Services.,5,Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Karachi Airport Hotel

SalimM,"We booked to stay here one night after our flight was cancelled. It did not come cheap so were expecting something special. Oh dear how wrong we were. Cheick was an utter nightmare with each of the three desks taking so long to check in those before us. When we got to the room it was dark and dingy. The Tv was not working and  it took four hours, several phone calls and finally a trip to receptions to get someone round to fix it. Oh and someone's clothes were left in the ward robe. This hotel used by airlines to house their crews so a ready made supply of corporate bookings. Maybe that is why no one cares about customer service. I would not pay and stay here knowing how bad it is. Breakfast at least was good once you could find someone to refill the empty pots. Enough said.",2,Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Karachi Airport Hotel
Mak,"Stayed for a night before my flight abroad and was somewhat bitterly disappointed - more so because these things can easily be fixed - after staying at other Ramada properties elsewhere.  Positives:  1. Location - minutes from the airport and the main travel route - Shahra-e-faisal 2. Great buffet/food in restaurant - Le T 3. Pool 4.5. Porters are good 5. Feel of a good resort, reasonably good space (but unfortunately seem to be let down by management and lack of imagination and customer focussed business sense)  Negatives:  1. Terrible housekeeping - double room with 2 pax booking had single utilities and toiletries, when complained, despite okays, no response for hours 2. No fridge or minibar in room 3 - No flat screen tvs on the wall 4. Sink tap angle is so bad that it leaks…",3,Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Karachi Airport Hotel

The kitchen is good (try the Pakistani breakfast), and the in-house rent-a-car service is reliable, competitive and very useful.

Kuresh,"Reserved room 304 (proclaimed to be Executive by Mr. Khurram) for me and my family. Requested for mattresses and got ones that were not suitable for a grown up adult. First thing that bugs you is the foul smell in the toilet. The tiles look pretty shabby. Room was big and well lit. It was too big for the poor 1.5 ton AC that attempted to cool it during our stay but couldn't achieve its target. Food!! Expensive!!! However the staff was courteous enough to cook off-menu meals for my kids who are pretty selective when it comes to food.  Hard luck struck us when on the third night of our stay the generator broke up. However we, upon much protest to the local management, were shifted to another guest house named Prestige Residence. That accommodation was worth living in though.…",3,Le Royal Guest House

It is right next to the Centaurus mall, so that is a huge plus, and the rest of Islamabad is no more than 15 minutes drive to every key location.   The food is also very good and hygienic. I went there on Eid and they made my trip memorable for my famil as well. Would love to stay there again.",5,Le Royal Guest House
Ali D,Myself and two off my friends had the pleasure of staying at the LeRoyale  The staff is very courteous and professional and are always attentive and available when you need them   Overall services provided by the guest house are good and you are made to feel comfortable   Rooms or at least the ones we stayed in are comfortable And spacious - morning complimentary breakfast is adequate   I would like to add that the Le royale needs  a refurbish - the toilets accessories and shower etc definitely need replacement - some of the furniture looks worn out and rugged   Since the place does get good reviews the owner should definitely consider up grading it   Location is fantastic - right in the middle of where you would want to be  Overall great place and would recommend it. ,4,Le Royal Guest House

My second stay however was very pleasant and all made sure that my first experience would not be repeated!  The staff was very friendly and helpful indeed! The room was cleaned perfectly and the facility that I used were functional!  The ""le Royal"" is well situated next to the most modern Mall. Within 2 min you are in another world.

Fahad R,"I've stayed at quite a few guest houses in Islamabad. Some have been great while others not so much. Due to full occupancy, Le Royal was recommended to us by the guest house I usually stay at. I have found it to be one of the few places where I actually felt like I was home. It's not the prettiest of the lot but what it lacks in looks, it makes up in hospitality. I wouldn't think twice about staying there.",4,Le Royal Guest House

Service was great and so was the food. I had no issues whatsoever with the management since the staff was extremely professional and efficient in executing the demands of the guest.

We have tried many dishes and every dish was so delicious. Just name it, fish Handi, chicken manchoorian and any Other dish. They were all tasty and delicious.

From the minute my flight landed at Islamabad airport Khurram was in communication with me to reassure me that a driver was waiting for me to drive me to the guest house.   Upon reaching Le Royal you immediately notice the very tight security. They have armed guards at the front of the guest house 24hours a day and beyond the gate is another security measure with a large barrier to ensure the highest level of safety.
